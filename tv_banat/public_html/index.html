                                        The availability of low-cost flights and last minute internet
                                        deals means that cheap holidays are far easier to come by than
                                        they used to be, but it can still take a bit of shopping 
                                        around to get the best discounts.
                                        1. Fly from further afield
                                        This may sound silly, but by widening your choice of departure 
                                        airport, you could save a lot of money.<br>
                                        The larger airports
                                        carry more flights and that allows airlines to keep prices low.
                                        By flying from a bigger UK airport such as Manchester, Stanstead,
                                        Heathrow or Gatwick, you could save a lot of money on your flights.
                                        2. Travel out of season
                                        If you’re not bound by school holidays, take the opportunity to 
                                        travel out of season and fly during the week rather than at weekends. 
                                        Flights are often cheaper during these times in order to encourage 
                                        travel, so think about leaving on a Thursday rather than a Friday 
                                        and see what a difference it could make to the price.

                                    You have just invested in a new vehicle, the one 
                                    of your dreams, and you take it on a trip across Canada.
                                    You only put gas in it and drive sightseeing and 
                                    following your nose. Filters and oil changes 
                                    are ignored. The car breaks down in the middle 
                                    of that long stretch of road between Manitoba
                                    and Alberta. It takes two days to get you up 
                                    and running and the bill is more than a year’s
                                    worth of oil changes and regular maintenance. 
                                    Just like the family vehicle, your business
                                    computer systems require regular maintenance
                                    to ensure optimum system performance and uptime 
                                    to prevent productivity losses. What really happens during system failure? 
                                    The user is unable to do their job using the 
                                    productivity tools you have provided Potentially
                                    this may affect two or more employees if their
                                    activities are linked The system failure may be 
                                    enterprise wide, causing everyone down time 
                                    The failure may happen at the “worst possible time”.

                                    The people affected must contact the support 
                                    person and explain the issue. Hopefully, the
                                    service provider is immediately available and
                                    they must only wait while the technician travels
                                    to the site. Once on site, the technician must 
                                    diagnose the problem and implement the repair. 
                                    Will parts be needed? Will they need to be ordered?
                                    Will a temporary loaner be required? Will software
                                    need to be reloaded? Will software support need to be contacted? 
                                    All of these will add to the time to resolve the problem. 
                                    During this time one or more of your staff will 
                                    be unable to do their job using the tools provided.

                                    cost of a pro-active repair?

                                <p class="short-description">WordPress, the premier free open-source 
                                    blogging utility, has gone through several upgrades in its life. 
                                    Today it’s one of the most popular blogging tools on the
                                    Internet; it’s easy to use, powerful, and very versatile. 
                                    It also has a very active base of skilled users who 
                                    are eager to improve the product and to help out
                                    those who haven’t tried it before.
                                    Though the Strayhorn 1.5 version is the favorite
                                    for many, it is not as stable or as secure as 
                                    the newest version 2.0.3. The best part of the 
                                    new version is the security patch; the new “nonce”
                                    security key reduces the chances of a malicious 
                                    hacker finding a way into your admin panel.
                                    Besides the security patch, though, several minor
                                    bugs have been squashed with this version.
                                    Though a major upgrade to 2.1 is due out soon,
                                    the 2.0.3 is something you should definitely 
                                    download and install if only because of the security fixes,
                                    which were actually backported from the major upgrade files.
                                    In addition to the 2.0.3 install, you should be aware
                                    that some bugs have already been found, and that 
                                    a plugin will need to be installed to repair those bugs. 
                                    If you modify any of the files that this patch 
                                    plugin fixes, you’ll need to either merge the
                                    changes with the new files or make those changes 
                                    manually once again. You can find these issues 
                                    by running a diff to locate changes; if the only
                                    changes you find are your own, then you’re fine,
                                    and otherwise you’ll need to merge them manually into the new files.
                                    The short list of what WordPress 2.0.3 fixes includes:

                                        When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only,
                                        what would that wish be?” almost everyone; from 
                                        beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to 
                                        religious leaders, to children, to the average
                                        person on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or
                                        “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary,
                                        are meaningless. As long as humans exist there 
                                        will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history
                                        of humankind there has never been peace on earth. 
                                        Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food 
                                        and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect.
                                        Gabriel blew down the walls of Jericho. America 
                                        fought the Revolutionary War for freedom and brother 
                                        fought against brother in our Civil War for more freedom.
                                        There have always been wars and there will always be wars. 
                                        As long as humans can think, there will be wars. Wars over 
                                        such concepts as freedom, honor, dignity, etc.. Wars over
                                        territory, greed, power, prejudice, etc.. War is a part 
                                        of human nature. For example, every human being is prejudiced.
                                        If they don’t like some race, nationality or religion, 
                                        they don’t like short or tall or fat or skinny or smart
                                        or not smart or loud or quiet people. Some people don’t like
                                        children, some people don’t like old people, some people 
                                        don’t like people with pets, or people that play their music
                                        too loud, or bad drivers, or people that believe in God or
                                        people that don’t believe in God. What is right and proper 
                                        to some people can be wrong or even enraging to other people. 
                                        Religion can not stop wars, in fact many wars are fought 
                                        over religion (Note: I believe that religion is used as 
                                        an excuse for war not the real reason for war.). Christians 
                                        fought against Muslims during the Crusades, Many Muslims want 
                                        death for all non believers. The Catholic Church killed heretics
                                        during the Inquisition. The Nazis killed millions of Jews and 
                                        then started killing Catholics. The Russians under Stalin 
                                        killed anyone even remotly religious. Protestants killed other 
                                        Protestants for being the wrong type of Protestant. Muslims killed
                                        Muslims for being the wrong type of Muslim. Don’t forget about 
                                        Atheists (I believe that Atheism is also a religion, it is a 
                                        religion of non belief.), Stalin was an Atheist and wanted to
                                        get rid of all religion. Most of China’s leaders are Atheists 
                                        and have jailed and killed huge numbers of religious people. 
                                        History is rife with various types of religious battles. 
                                        The main reason for war, however, is the lust for power. 
                                        The power to make others do and believe as you do and believe,
                                        the power to make other people render unto you what you believe
                                        is rightfully yours, the power to make other people treat you 
                                        as you believe you should be treated, the power to gain what 
                                        you want (ie: money, love, respect, etc.), the power to punish 
                                        others for doing things that you don’t believe they should do, 
                                        the power to keep other from having things or thoughts that 
                                        you don’t have. In other words, the power to be, in some ways 
                                        God, to make everyone else in your image with you as their ruler.
                                        As long as people have the ability to think, there will be greed, 
                                        envy, prejudice and anger. As long as those things exist, 
                                        there will be wars. Most people believe, either religiously 
                                        or secularly, in the rules set down in the Ten Commandments, 
                                        but very few people can follow those rules all of the time
                                        because our ability to think causes us to want. Wanting causes 
                                        us to break some or all of the rules. Humans are not perfect. 
                                        If they were they would not be human.

                                        With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman
                                        has contributed so much to human sanity as has 
                                        Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the 
                                        Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. 
                                        There could be no greater lapse: for two important 
                                        decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at 
                                        the eye of all the important cultural storms. 
                                        He fathered quite a few of them.
                                        This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize 
                                        his work before suggesting a few (minor) 
                                        modifications to it.
                                        (1) Society consists of practices: economic, 
                                        political and ideological.
                                        Althusser defines a practice as:
                                        “Any process of transformation of a determinate
                                        product, affected
                                        by a determinate human labour, using determinate 
                                        means (of production)”
                                        The economic practice (the historically specific
                                        mode of production) transforms raw materials to
                                        finished products using human labour and other
                                        means of production, all organized within defined 
                                        webs of inter-relations. The political practice does
                                        the same with social relations as the raw materials. 
                                        Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way 
                                        that a subject relates to his real life 
                                        conditions of existence.
                                        This is a rejection of the mechanistic 
                                        worldview (replete with bases and superstructures).
                                        It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology.
                                        It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”.
                                        It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.
                                        In it, the very existence and reproduction of the social
                                        base (not merely its expression) is dependent upon 
                                        the social superstructure. The superstructure is 
                                        “relatively autonomous” and ideology has a central 
                                        part in it – see entry about Marx and Engels and 
                                        entry concerning Hegel.
                                        The economic structure is determinant but another 
                                        structure could be dominant, depending on the historical
                                        conjuncture. Determination (now called over-determination – 
                                        see Note) specifies the form of economic production 
                                        upon which the dominant practice depends.
                                        Put otherwise: the economic is determinant not 
                                        because the practices of the social formation 
                                        (political and ideological) are the social 
                                        formation’s expressive epiphenomena – but because
                                        it determines WHICH of them is dominant.
                                        (2) People relate to the conditions of 
                                        existence through the practice of ideology. 
                                        Contradictions are smoothed over and (real)
                                        problems are offered false (though seemingly true) solutions.
                                        Thus, ideology has a realistic dimension – and a dimension 
                                        of representations (myths, concepts, ideas, images). 
                                        There is (harsh, conflicting) reality – and the way
                                        that we represent it both to ourselves and to others.
                                        (3) To achieve the above, ideology must not be seen 
                                        to err or, worse, remain speechless. It, therefore, 
                                        confronts and poses (to itself) only answerable questions.
                                        This way, it remains confined to a fabulous, legendary,
                                        contradiction-free domain. It ignores other questions altogether.
                                        (4) Althusser introduced the concept of “The Problematic”:
                                        “The objective internal reference … the system of questions
                                        commanding the answers given”
                                        It determines which problems, questions and answers are
                                        part of the game – and which should be blacklisted and
                                        never as much as mentioned. It is a structure of theory 
                                        (ideology), a framework and the repertoire of discourses 
                                        which – ultimately – yield a text or a practice. 
                                        All the rest is excluded.
                                        It, therefore, becomes clear that what is omitted 
                                        is of no less importance than what is included in a text.
                                        The problematic of a text relates to its historical
                                        context (“moment”) by incorporating both: inclusions 
                                        as well as omissions, presences as much as absences. 
                                        The problematic of the text fosters the generation 
                                        of answers to posed questions – and of defective
                                        answers to excluded questions.
                                        (5) The task of “scientific” (e.g., Marxist) discourse,
                                        of Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct 
                                        the problematic, to read through ideology and 
                                        evidence the real conditions of existence.
                                        This is a “symptomatic reading” of TWO TEXTS:
                                        “It divulges the undivulged event in the text 
                                        that it reads and, in the
                                        same movement, relates to it a different text,
                                        present, as a necessary
                                        absence, in the first … (Marx’s reading of Adam Smith)
                                        presupposes
                                        the existence of two texts and the measurement
                                        of the first against
                                        the second. But what distinguishes this new
                                        reading from the old,
                                        is the fact that in the new one, the second 
                                        text is articulated with the
                                        lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) 
                                        the problematic contained
                                        in the paradox of an answer which does not
                                        correspond to any questions posed.”
                                        Althusser is contrasting the manifest 
                                        text with a latent text which is the result
                                        of the lapses, distortions, silences and
                                        absences in the manifest text. The latent 
                                        text is the “diary of the struggle” of the
                                        unposed question to be posed and answered.
                                        (6) Ideology is a practice with lived and 
                                        material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals,
                                        behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. 
                                        The State employs Ideological Apparatuses 
                                        (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices
                                        and productions: (organized) religion, the
                                        education system, the family, (organized) politics,
                                        the media, the industries of culture.
                                        “All ideology has the function (which defines it) 
                                        of ‘constructing’
                                        concrete individuals as subjects”
                                        Subjects to what? The answer: to the material
                                        practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects)
                                        is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”.
                                        These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , 
                                        forcing the individuals to generate meaning 
                                        (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                                        These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the
                                        Advertising and the film industries.
                                        The ideology of consumption (which is, undeniably, 
                                        the most material of all practices) uses 
                                        advertising to transform individuals to 
                                        subjects (=to consumers). It uses advertising
                                        to interpellate them. The advertisements
                                        attract attention, force people to introduce 
                                        meaning to them and, as a result, to consume.
                                        The most famous example is the use of “People
                                        like you (buy this or do that)” in ads. 
                                        The reader / viewer is interpellated both
                                        as an individual (“you”) and as a member of
                                        a group (“people like…”). He occupies the
                                        empty (imaginary) space of the “you” in the ad.
                                        This is ideological “misrecognition”. 
                                        First, many others misrecognize themselves 
                                        as that “you” (an impossibility in the real world).
                                        Secondly, the misrecognized “you” exists only 
                                        in the ad because it was created by it, it has
                                        no real world correlate.
                                        The reader or viewer of the ad is transformed 
                                        into the subject of (and subject to) the
                                        material practice of the ideology 
                                        (consumption, in this case).
                                        Althusser was a Marxist. The dominant 
                                        mode of production in his days (and even more so today)
                                        was capitalism. His implied criticism of 
                                        the material dimensions of ideological 
                                        practices should be taken with more than 
                                        a grain of salt. Interpellated by the 
                                        ideology of Marxism himself, he generalized 
                                        on his personal experience and described 
                                        ideologies as infallible, omnipotent, ever 
                                        successful. Ideologies, to him, were impeccably
                                        functioning machines which can always be
                                        relied upon to reproduce subjects with all 
                                        the habits and thought patterns required 
                                        by the dominant mode of production.
                                        And this is where Althusser fails, trapped
                                        by dogmatism and more than a touch of paranoia. 
                                        He neglects to treat two all-important 
                                        questions (his problematic may have not allowed it):
                                        (a) What do ideologies look for? Why do they
                                        engage in their practice? What is the ultimate goal?
                                        (b) What happens in a pluralistic environment
                                        rich in competing ideologies?
                                        Althusser stipulates the existence of two 
                                        texts, manifest and hidden. The latter 
                                        co-exists with the former, very much as
                                        a black figure defines its white background. 
                                        The background is also a figure and it is
                                        only arbitrarily – the result of historical
                                        conditioning – that we bestow a preferred 
                                        status upon the one. The latent text can be
                                        extracted from the manifest one by listening 
                                        to the absences, the lapses and the silences
                                        in the manifest text.
                                        But: what dictates the laws of extraction? 
                                        how do we know that the latent text thus 
                                        exposed is THE right one? Surely, there 
                                        must exist a procedure of comparison, 
                                        authentication and verification of the latent text?
                                        A comparison of the resulting latent text
                                        to the manifest text from which it was
                                        extracted would be futile because it would
                                        be recursive. This is not even a process 
                                        of iteration. It is teutological. There must
                                        exist a THIRD, “master-text”, a privileged text,
                                        historically invariant, reliable, unequivocal 
                                        (indifferent to interpretation-frameworks),
                                        universally accessible, atemporal and
                                        non-spatial. This third text is COMPLETE 
                                        in the sense that it includes both the 
                                        manifest and the latent. Actually, it should
                                        include all the possible texts (a LIBRARY function).
                                        The historical moment will determine which
                                        of them will be manifest and which latent, 
                                        according to the needs of the mode of 
                                        production and the various practices.
                                        Not all these texts will be conscious 
                                        and accessible to the individual but such 
                                        a text would embody and dictate the rules
                                        of comparison between the manifest text 
                                        and ITSELF (the Third Text) , being the COMPLETE text.
                                        Only through a comparison between a partial
                                        text and a complete text can the deficiencies
                                        of the partial text be exposed. A comparison
                                        between partial texts will yield no certain
                                        results and a comparison between the text 
                                        and itself (as Althusser suggests) is absolutely meaningless.
                                        This Third Text is the human psyche. 
                                        We constantly compare texts that we read 
                                        to this Third Text, a copy of which we all
                                        carry with us. We are unaware of most of 
                                        the texts incorporated in this master text of ours.
                                        When faced with a manifest text which is
                                        new to us, we first “download” the “rules 
                                        of comparison (engagement)”. We sift through 
                                        the manifest text. We compare it to our 
                                        COMPLETE master text and see which parts 
                                        are missing. These constitute the latent 
                                        text. The manifest text serves as a trigger 
                                        which brings to our consciousness appropriate
                                        and relevant portions of the Third Text. 
                                        It also generates the latent text in us.
                                        If this sounds familiar it is because this
                                        pattern of confronting (the manifest text),
                                        comparing (with our master text) and storing 
                                        the results (the latent text and the manifest
                                        text are brought to consciousness) – is used
                                        by mother nature itself. The DNA is such 
                                        a “Master Text, Third Text”. It includes 
                                        all the genetic-biological texts some manifest,
                                        some latent. Only stimuli in its environment
                                        (=a manifest text) can provoke it to generate
                                        its own (hitherto latent) “text”. The same would
                                        apply to computer applications.
                                        The Third Text, therefore, has an invariant
                                        nature (it includes all possible texts) – and,
                                        yet, is changeable by interacting with manifest texts.
                                        This contradiction is only apparent. The Third 
                                        Text does not change – only different parts of 
                                        it are brought to our awareness as a result of 
                                        the interaction with the manifest text. We can
                                        also safely say that one does not need to be 
                                        an Althusserian critic or engage in “scientific”
                                        discourse to deconstruct the problematic.
                                        Every reader of text immediately and always 
                                        deconstructs it. The very act of reading involves
                                        comparison with the Third Text which inevitably
                                        leads to the generation of a latent text.
                                        And this precisely is why some interpellations fail.
                                        The subject deconstructs every message even
                                        if he is not trained in critical practice.
                                        He is interpellated or fails to be interpellated
                                        depending on what latent message was generated
                                        through the comparison with the Third Text.
                                        And because the Third Text includes ALL possible
                                        texts, the subject is given to numerous 
                                        competing interpellations offered by many 
                                        ideologies, mostly at odds with each other.
                                        The subject is in an environment of COMPETING
                                        INTERPELLATIONS (especially in this day and
                                        age of information glut). The failure of 
                                        one interpellation – normally means the 
                                        success of another (whose interpellation 
                                        is based on the latent text generated in
                                        the comparison process or on a manifest 
                                        text of its own, or on a latent text generated by another text).
                                        There are competing ideologies even in the 
                                        most severe of authoritarian regimes. 
                                        Sometimes, IASs within the same social 
                                        formation offer competing ideologies: the 
                                        political Party, the Church, the Family,
                                        the Army, the Media, the Civilian Regime, 
                                        the Bureaucracy. To assume that interpellations
                                        are offered to the potential subjects 
                                        successively (and not in parallel) defies
                                        experience (though it does simplify the thought-system).
                                        Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.
                                        Advertising leads to the interpellation of the
                                        subject to effect the material practice of consumption.
                                        Put more simply: there is money involved. 
                                        Other ideologies – propagated through organized 
                                        religions, for instance – lead to prayer. 
                                        Could this be the material practice that 
                                        they are looking for? No way. Money, prayer,
                                        the very ability to interpellate – they are 
                                        all representations of power over other human beings.
                                        The business concern, the church, the political party,
                                        the family, the media, the culture industries – are all
                                        looking for the same thing: influence, power, might.
                                        Absurdly, interpellation is used to secure 
                                        one paramount thing: the ability to interpellate.
                                        Behind every material practice stands a psychological 
                                        practice (very much as the Third Text – the psyche – stands
                                        behind every text, latent or manifest).
                                        The media could be different: money, spiritual 
                                        prowess, physical brutality, subtle messages. 
                                        But everyone (even individuals in their private life) 
                                        is looking to hail and interpellate others and 
                                        thus manipulate them to succumb to their material practices.
                                        A short sighted view would say that the businessman 
                                        interpellates in order to make money.
                                        But the important question is: what ever for?
                                        What drives ideologies to establish material
                                        practices and to interpellate people to 
                                        participate in them and become subjects? 
                                        The will to power. the wish to be able to interpellate.
                                        It is this cyclical nature of Althusser’s 
                                        teachings (ideologies interpellate in order 
                                        to be able to interpellate) and his 
                                        dogmatic approach (ideologies never fail)
                                        which doomed his otherwise brilliant 
                                        observations to oblivion. In Althusser’s
                                        writings the Marxist determination remains 
                                        as Over-determination. This is a structured 
                                        articulation of a number of contradictions 
                                        and determinations (between the practices).
                                        This is very reminiscent of Freud’s Dream Theory
                                        and of the concept of Superposition in Quantum Mechanics.

                                        The French Revolution constituted for the 
                                        conscience of the dominant aristocratic class
                                        a fall from innocence, and upturning of the
                                        natural chain of events that resounded all 
                                        over Europe; the old regime became, in 
                                        their imaginary, a paradise lost. This 
                                        explains why some romantic poets born in 
                                        the higher classes were keen on seeing 
                                        themselves as faded aristocrats, expelled 
                                        from their comfortable milieu by a reverse 
                                        of fortune or a design of destiny. Byron and 
                                        Shelley are the prime instances of this 
                                        vital pose. In The Giaour he writes on a
                                        vampiric character: “The common crowd but 
                                        see the gloom/ Of wayward deeds and fitting 
                                        doom;/ The close observer can espy/A noble 
                                        soul, and lineage high.” 
                                        Byron departed from England leaving a trail 
                                        of scandal over his marital conduct and 
                                        since then saw himself as an exiled expatriate. 
                                        Shelley was expelled from Oxford and he 
                                        fell in disgrace by marrying an in-keeper’s 
                                        daughter; he always struggled to reconcile
                                        his origin with his political ideas: “Shelley
                                        could find no way of resolving his own contradictory
                                        opinions” (Cronin, 2000).
                                        This icon of the fallen aristocrat is rooted 
                                        on another character revered by romantic
                                        poets: the fallen angel. As Mario Praz proves,
                                        miltonic Satan became the rebel figure of 
                                        choice among romantic poets. Milton reversed 
                                        the medieval idea of a hideous Satan and wrapped 
                                        its figure with the epic grandeur of an angel
                                        fallen in disgrace. Many of the byronic heros
                                        share with Milton’s Satan this fallen-from-grace
                                        condition, such as Lara: “There was in him a 
                                        vital scorn of all:/ As if the worst had fall’n
                                        which could befall,/ stood a stranger in this
                                        breathing world,/An erring spirit from another
                                        hurl’d” ( Lara XVIII 315-16)
                                        There is another social factor that is behind 
                                        the formation of the romantic myth of the vampire.
                                        In the early nineteen century, the foundations 
                                        of what would later become a mass society were
                                        laid; the expansion of the press and of the
                                        reading public produced an increased diffusion
                                        for literary works and fostered movements such 
                                        as the gothic and the sensation novel.
                                        Byron himself experienced the event of 
                                        being turned into a proto-bestseller. 
                                        The unification of literary taste and 
                                        preferences that was a correlate to this 
                                        social changes could not be more alien to
                                        the romantic notion of individual gusto
                                        and original sensibility. In order to combat
                                        this unifying forces, romantic poets revered 
                                        the individual who stands outside society and 
                                        is free from common concerns. Many of Byron’s
                                        heros look down on the masses from above, 
                                        even though they walk among them and do not
                                        lean towards wordsworthian escapades
                                        into nature; they achieve to remain untainted 
                                        by the masses in a sort of exile within the
                                        world akin to that of a ghost or a dammed spirit.
                                        This self-definition of Manfred is revelatory:
                                        From my youth upwards
                                        My spirit walk’d not with the souls of men,
                                        Nor look’d upon the earth with human eyes; 
                                        The thirst of their ambition was not mine,
                                        The aim of their existence was not mine;
                                        My joys, my griefs, my passions, and my powers
                                        Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,
                                        I had no sympathy with breathing flesh, 
                                        (Manfred II, ii, 50-58)
                                        Not only Byron’s works contrived to produce 
                                        the modern image of the vampire in relation
                                        to the Male Seducer archetype, but also some
                                        odd events in his life and the life of those 
                                        surrounding him exercised a decisive influence.
                                        A critical study bundled with an anthology of 
                                        vampire tales (Conde de Siruela, 2001) attributes
                                        to the short story The Vampire (1819) by 
                                        John William Polidori the fixation of the
                                        “classical images of the literary vampire as 
                                        a villanious, cold and enigmatic aristocrat;
                                        but, above all, perverse and fascinating for women”.
                                        Mario Praz, in the same line, also states that 
                                        Byron was “largely responsible for the vogue of vampirism”.
                                        Polidori was the unfortunate doctor and
                                        personal assistant of Lord Byron who died 
                                        half-crazy at 25. The idea for the tale 
                                        published in 1819 came from the famous 
                                        meetings at Villa Diodati on June 1816 
                                        between Byron, Percy Shelley, Mary Shelley 
                                        and Polidori, in what was probably the most
                                        influential gathering for fantastic fiction
                                        in the history of modern literature.
                                        In order to pass the stormy and ether-fuelled nights,
                                        they agreed to write each one a ghost story. 
                                        Mary Shelley (who was then 17 years old) got 
                                        during these nights the idea of what later 
                                        became Frankenstein and Polidori wrote the 
                                        tale The Vampire that he would publish three 
                                        years later. The story appeared in the 
                                        New Monthly Magazine falsely attributed 
                                        by the editor to Lord Byron (taking advantages
                                        of the aura of Satanism that surrounded 
                                        the poet in the popular view to promote the
                                        sales of the magazine). A misguided Goethe
                                        hailed the story as the best that Lord Byron
                                        had ever written. The tale was, actually,
                                        a covert portrait of Lord Byron disguised 
                                        as the vampire Lord Ruthven, a cruel gambler
                                        and killer of innocent girls. 
                                        Polidori had introduced in the story fragments
                                        from an autobiographical and revengeful 
                                        novel called Glenarvon written by Caroline Lamb,
                                        an ex-lover of Byron. The Lord

                                        Sierra Tarahumara, popularly known as 
                                        Copper Canyon is situated in Mexico. 
                                        The area is a favorite destination among 
                                        those seeking an adventurous vacation. 
                                        Copper Canyon is one of the six gorges in the area.
                                        Although the name suggests that the gorge 
                                        might have some relevance to copper mining,
                                        this is not the case. The name is derived 
                                        from the copper and green lichen covering the canyon. 
                                        Copper Canyon has two climatic zones. 
                                        The region features an alpine climate at 
                                        the top and a subtropical climate at the lower levels.
                                        Winters are cold with frequent snowstorms 
                                        at the higher altitudes. Summers are dry and hot.
                                        The capital city, Chihuahua, is a high 
                                        altitude desert where weather ranges from 
                                        cold winters to hot summers. The region is 
                                        unique because of the various ecosystems that exist within it.
                                        Another unique feature of Copper Canyon is 
                                        the presence of the Tarahumara Indian culture.
                                        These semi-nomadic people live in cave dwellings.
                                        Their livelihood chiefly depends on farming
                                        and cattle ranching. Apart from the native
                                        population, the local wildlife is also a 
                                        major crowd puller. Several migratory and 
                                        native birds, mammals and reptiles call
                                        Copper Canyon their home. The exquisite 
                                        fauna in this near-pristine land is also 
                                        worth checking out. A traveler may choose 
                                        to explore the area by hiking around the 
                                        canyon or venturing into it. Detailed 
                                        planning is required for those who wish 
                                        to venture into the depths of the canyon. 
                                        There are a number of travel companies 
                                        that specialize in organizing tours to
                                        the region. Visitors can fly to Copper 
                                        Canyon using a tourist visa, which is 
                                        valid for 180 days. Travelers can also 
                                        drive from anywhere in the United States 
                                        and acquire a visa at the Mexican customs 
                                        station at the border. A holiday to the 
                                        Copper Canyon promises to be an exciting 
                                        mix of relaxation, culture, history, wildlife and hiking.

                                        enjoy a luxury vacation even on a tight budget.
                                        After all, you’ve worked hard all year long,
                                        and your vacation should be a relaxing, 
                                        fun experience. Here are some travel tips to 
                                        help you budget for your global travel and
                                        vacations and find great deals on luxury
                                        resorts around the world.
                                        Create a Vacation Savings Plan
                                        Instead of trying to gather up enough money 
                                        for vacation at the last minute, develop
                                        a savings plan at the start of each year.
                                        Save only $20 per week and you’ll have 
                                        $1040.00 after 12 months. This can take 
                                        care of the hotel bill and maybe more if 
                                        you find a great bargain!
                                        Save Money on Food
                                        When you arrive at your destination, go 
                                        shopping for groceries. Note: Be sure the
                                        hotel or resort provides a refrigerator 
                                        and microwave or stove. Save your “dining out” 
                                        money for a few really special evenings out.
                                        This will allow you to enjoy a few delicious
                                        meals instead of wasting dollars on fast 
                                        food every day. One family-of-four meal at 
                                        a fast food restaurant could cost $30 USD or more!
                                        Reserve in Advance
                                        If you know far enough in advance where and 
                                        when you will take your holiday, you can
                                        book your hotel and flight in advance and
                                        receive savings. Phone the hotel or resort 
                                        where you would like to stay several months 
                                        ahead and ask them to mail their latest
                                        brochure to you. Often times the brochures
                                        will contain rates for certain dates 
                                        along with coupons. You can take advantage 
                                        of “early bird” or “off-season” discounts.
                                        Get to Know Local or Online Travel Agents
                                        Contact local travel agents in your area 
                                        and ask to be notified when special deals arise.
                                        They are willing to help because they get
                                        paid a commission. Also, ask about brochures
                                        to various luxury resorts around the world 
                                        so you can get an idea of where you would like to go.
                                        You can also join with a travel group online
                                        to receive enormous discounts on four and 
                                        five star luxury resorts in Europe, Asia,
                                        Greece, Egypt, Israel, and many other destinations.
                                        Whether you’d like to stay at a beach resort,
                                        ski resort, golf resort, or take ocean 
                                        cruises, they will do the research for 
                                        you using their years of expertise. 
                                        For even more savings, you can also sell
                                        global travel and vacations or memberships 
                                        to others through a travel group and earn money.
                                        This allows you to work at home with your 
                                        very own travel business or at least pay for your own vacation!
                                        Plan Activities Online
                                        Once you know your destination, you can plan 
                                        some of the more expensive activities online
                                        in advance to enjoy Internet savings. 
                                        Popular amusement parks, museums, and 
                                        entertainment venues often give a discount
                                        for ordering tickets online in advance.
                                        Save on Air Fare
                                        If traveling by plane, try bidding on tickets
                                        to get a good price or look for departure 
                                        times that offer cheaper rates. Many airlines
                                        cost less during the off-seasons as well.
                                        No matter what your travel budget, you can 
                                        enjoy a great vacation if you do enough 
                                        advance planning. Make the most of your 
                                        holiday while spending less!

                                        People are wanting to fly to international
                                        destinations for vacations but planning a
                                        holiday getaway can easily turn into a 
                                        stressful venture when the matter of costs comes up. 
                                        However, airfare can be very expensive. 
                                        Air fare by itself can kill the excitement.
                                        And when people already factor in accommodations,
                                        food, and shopping, or any other would 
                                        just give up and stay home.If you think on
                                        taking a vacation that requires any sort
                                        of wide planning, such as out of the country
                                        or worldwide even to a popular destination 
                                        in a different state, it is probably going 
                                        to be necessary for you to enlist the services 
                                        of a travel agency.
                                        Try to find out which travel agency you are
                                        considering is helpful with. Agencies with 
                                        more extensive (think global) affiliations 
                                        are more likely to be able to get you lower
                                        prices and added favors for your vacations.
                                        Keep in mind, however, that just because 
                                        they are affiliated with a large group 
                                        does not mean that the agency itself has 
                                        to be bigger. Common knowledge would suggest
                                        that the bigger the agency, the easier it 
                                        is to negotiate lower prices. 
                                        At last, ask for references from the agency
                                        of both clients and dealers. Clients of course,
                                        are people like your self who have used the 
                                        agency’s services to visit on vacations earlier. 
                                        Dealers are the people with whom the agency
                                        deals in order to purchase items such as
                                        hotel rooms and airline tickets, and will
                                        often have a clearer thought of how the
                                        agency operates and where or not they can
                                        do all that they claim as far as cost 
                                        cutting and favors. So, how does lower

                                        Motorhome or Trailer that is the question for you.
                                        Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages
                                        of both, so you will be confident when purchasing an RV.
                                        When comparing Rvs, a motorhome or a travel 
                                        trailer, should you buy a motorhome or fifth 
                                        wheeler? The advantages and disadvantages 
                                        of both are studied so that you can make 
                                        your choice wisely when purchasing an RV. 
                                        Possessing a motorhome or fifth wheel is 
                                        an achievement of a lifetime. It can be
                                        similar to sojourning with your residence 
                                        as you search the various sites of our great land, America.
                                        The two commonly known recreational vehicle
                                        classes are the motorized and towable. 
                                        Towable rvs are the travel trailers and 
                                        the fifth wheel. The rv travel trailer 
                                        or fifth wheel has the attraction of getting
                                        towed by a pickup or a car, thus giving 
                                        the adaptability of possessing transportation
                                        for you when you are parked at your campsite. 
                                        A motorhome is a recreational vehicle that
                                        is motorized. It has three categories which
                                        can either be gas, diesel or Diesel Pushers 
                                        which are the most costly ones. Converted 
                                        vans that are large and self-sustaining 
                                        represent the smaller types of motorhomes
                                        and then there are the ones that are built 
                                        on the chassis of a truck.. The motorized
                                        motor home needs a tow car for your transportation 
                                        after you set up in your campsite.
                                        Rvs are styled to your specifications for 
                                        the best appearance and luxuries you 
                                        anticipate when possessing an rv. 
                                        High standard artisanship, venues for 
                                        entertainment, and keenness to small
                                        bits of information can be applied into
                                        an rv bearing in mind that each and every 
                                        amenity comes with a price tag.
                                        A travel trailer or fifth wheel is larger
                                        inside than a motorhome of the same size 
                                        because of the driving area, i.e. a 40 foot 
                                        trailer or fifth wheel has more livable 
                                        space than a 40 foot motorhome. 
                                        Towing a trailer with a car puts a lot of 
                                        wear and tear on the automobile because 
                                        they are usually not equipped for heavy duty towing.
                                        The motor home is definitely more money 
                                        because you are paying for the driving 
                                        mechanism and chassis. Trailers and motorhomes
                                        can be equipped with the same options. 
                                        So the question seems to be do I want to 
                                        travel in a truck pulling a large fifth 
                                        wheel or ride in a motorhome pulling a tow car.
                                        One thing is certain if you talk to a 
                                        motorhome owner he will tell you that you 
                                        should definitely purchase a motorhome 
                                        and the same goes for a travel trailer or
                                        fifth wheel owner, he thinks the trailer 
                                        is the only way to go.  No matter what you 
                                        choose the experiences are out of this world.

                                        of Deliberate Attraction? Is there an advanced

                                        “The application of this material into your daily 
                                        life IS the advanced course!” To help you gauge
                                        where you’re at in the mastery of Law of Attraction,
                                        I’ve compiled a list of seven sure-fire 
                                        ways to tell if YOU are joining the thousands 
                                        of people who really are mastering this stuff.
                                        7 TOP indicators that I am mastering Law of Attraction
                                        1. I understand and accept that Law of 
                                        Attraction is a process. It is a process 
                                        of gradually reducing the negative vibrational
                                        patterns I have towards some areas in my
                                        life and replacing them with positive thoughts.
                                        Through the intentional and deliberate use of 
                                        the tools of Law of Attraction, I see 
                                        evidence that my allowing is gradually increasing.
                                        2. Over time I am seeing some behavioural 
                                        changes in myself. Even though I constantly
                                        hear others using don’t, not and no I have
                                        eventually stopped using these words out loud.
                                        Each time I catch myself even thinking these
                                        words, I automatically ask myself the question,
                                        “So what DO I want?” I know that when I change
                                        my words, my vibration changes and I can 
                                        only hold one vibration at a time.
                                        3. I’ve noticed over time that I am observing
                                        contrast (anything that doesn’t feel good to me) 
                                        more and more briefly.
                                        4. I’ve noticed that I am having fewer
                                        and fewer experiences of negative people
                                        and events in my life. 5. It’s become
                                        second nature for me to be aware of many
                                        , many more things that I can appreciate
                                        and express gratitude for.
                                        6. I find myself automatically assigning 
                                        all my new desires to Law of Attraction.
                                        When I want something new in my life 
                                        I say, “I’m using Law of Attraction to get that!”
                                        7. I understand the expression I get what
                                        I vibrate and I hold myself fully accountable
                                        for everything that shows up in my life,
                                        both positive and negative!

                                        take away any of the “fun” of your hobby 
                                        of astronomy because the joy of what we
                                        do as star gazers is a big part of the appeal.
                                        But unlike many other hobbies, ours is a 
                                        passion of science, of learning and of discovery.
                                        And don’t kid yourself, even a hobbyist with
                                        a limited telescopic set up can see some 
                                        amazing things in the stars. So let’s be sure
                                        you invest in a solid piece of equipment 
                                        that you can continue to grow with as your
                                        knowledge and ability as an astronomer grows.
                                        But how do we do that?
                                        Meet the Geeks.
                                        Now we use the term “telescope geeks” lovingly
                                        because any of us who are devoted to our love
                                        of astronomy eventually become telescope geeks.
                                        And these are the type of people who will know 
                                        exactly how to evaluate your needs in terms 
                                        of where you are right now and where you want
                                        to go as your hobby grows with you. So if 
                                        you have not yet associated with a local 
                                        astronomy club, now is the time to do it. 
                                        Start rubbing elbows with people who live
                                        and breathe telescopes. Their input is a 
                                        hundred times more reliable than what a 
                                        sales brochure or that salesman might have 
                                        to say because the “telescope geeks” have
                                        been where you are, made the mistakes and
                                        are eager to help you avoid those same mistakes.
                                        Size Matters
                                        In the world of telescopes, the sales people
                                        see, to try to baffle us with all the bells
                                        and whistles of their hottest selling model.
                                        One of the big check points that is often 
                                        pushed is the amplification level of the 
                                        telescope lens. While that is a factor that
                                        is worth noting, when it comes to a telescope 
                                        lens, the old phrase “size matters” is a good guideline.
                                        Just remember that your telescope lens works
                                        best when it takes in the most light it 
                                        can from the object you are viewing. 
                                        So the wider the diameter of the lens,
                                        the better a view you are going to get.
                                        So don’t fall for the amplification level only.
                                        Carefully evaluate the lens size so you
                                        have the right fit for what you want to do.
                                        It Has to Stand on Its Own Feet.
                                        If you are going to set up a permanent
                                        telescope station, then you can bolt the
                                        unit down so it is well supported. But many 
                                        of us have to take our telescopes out into 
                                        the country for optimum use. So the stand
                                        has to be strong and flexible so we can 
                                        set up the telescope on uneven turf but 
                                        still feel secure that this important and 
                                        expensive piece of equipment is going to
                                        stand on its own without fear of it falling 
                                        during our observation time. 
                                        We already mentioned strong and flexible 
                                        as evaluation guides for the telescope 
                                        stand but add in ease of use as well. 
                                        You have to be able to set your telescope
                                        up and break it down quickly and easily 
                                        when you are on a remote viewing. You may
                                        even find yourself setting up or taking
                                        down your telescope in the dark or by lantern
                                        or flashlight if you are taking advantage 
                                        of the great star displays in the late night
                                        sky that make this hobby so exciting. 
                                        These are the basics of what to look for 
                                        in your new telescope. Finally, make sure 
                                        the telescope can be enhanced and expanded
                                        without having to throw the first unit away
                                        and buy something completely new. You want
                                        your telescope to grow as your knowledge 
                                        and skills grow. If your first telescope 
                                        meets all of these requirements, you are 
                                        off on the right foot on a long and enjoyable
                                        career as an amateur astronomer.
