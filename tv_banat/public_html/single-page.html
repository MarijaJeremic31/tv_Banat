                                    and distractive habit. Statistics show 
                                    that while 85 percent of the adult population 
                                    in the US enjoys some type of gambling every year,
                                    between 2 and 3 percent of will develop a 
                                    gambling problem and 1 percent of them are

                                    you draw the line between harmless gambling 
                                    to problem gambling?

                                                When asked, “If you could wish for one thing only,
                                                what would that wish be?” almost everyone; from 
                                                beauty pagent contestants, to politicians, to 
                                                religious leaders, to children, to the average
                                                person on the street states, “Peace On Earth” or
                                                “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary,
                                                are meaningless. As long as humans exist there 
                                                will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history
                                                of humankind there has never been peace on earth. 
                                                Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food 
                                                and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect.
                                                Gabriel blew down the walls of Jericho. America 
                                                fought the Revolutionary War for freedom and brother 
                                                fought against brother in our Civil War for more freedom.
                                                There have always been wars and there will always be wars. 
                                                As long as humans can think, there will be wars. Wars over 
                                                such concepts as freedom, honor, dignity, etc.. Wars over
                                                territory, greed, power, prejudice, etc.. War is a part 
                                                of human nature. For example, every human being is prejudiced.
                                                If they don’t like some race, nationality or religion, 
                                                they don’t like short or tall or fat or skinny or smart
                                                or not smart or loud or quiet people. Some people don’t like
                                                children, some people don’t like old people, some people 
                                                don’t like people with pets, or people that play their music
                                                too loud, or bad drivers, or people that believe in God or
                                                people that don’t believe in God. What is right and proper 
                                                to some people can be wrong or even enraging to other people. 
                                                Religion can not stop wars, in fact many wars are fought 
                                                over religion (Note: I believe that religion is used as 
                                                an excuse for war not the real reason for war.). Christians 
                                                fought against Muslims during the Crusades, Many Muslims want 
                                                death for all non believers. The Catholic Church killed heretics
                                                during the Inquisition. The Nazis killed millions of Jews and 
                                                then started killing Catholics. The Russians under Stalin 
                                                killed anyone even remotly religious. Protestants killed other 
                                                Protestants for being the wrong type of Protestant. Muslims killed
                                                Muslims for being the wrong type of Muslim. Don’t forget about 
                                                Atheists (I believe that Atheism is also a religion, it is a 
                                                religion of non belief.), Stalin was an Atheist and wanted to
                                                get rid of all religion. Most of China’s leaders are Atheists 
                                                and have jailed and killed huge numbers of religious people. 
                                                History is rife with various types of religious battles. 
                                                The main reason for war, however, is the lust for power. 
                                                The power to make others do and believe as you do and believe,
                                                the power to make other people render unto you what you believe
                                                is rightfully yours, the power to make other people treat you 
                                                as you believe you should be treated, the power to gain what 
                                                you want (ie: money, love, respect, etc.), the power to punish 
                                                others for doing things that you don’t believe they should do, 
                                                the power to keep other from having things or thoughts that 
                                                you don’t have. In other words, the power to be, in some ways 
                                                God, to make everyone else in your image with you as their ruler.
                                                As long as people have the ability to think, there will be greed, 
                                                envy, prejudice and anger. As long as those things exist, 
                                                there will be wars. Most people believe, either religiously 
                                                or secularly, in the rules set down in the Ten Commandments, 
                                                but very few people can follow those rules all of the time
                                                because our ability to think causes us to want. Wanting causes 
                                                us to break some or all of the rules. Humans are not perfect. 
                                                If they were they would not be human.

                                                With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman
                                                has contributed so much to human sanity as has 
                                                Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the 
                                                Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. 
                                                There could be no greater lapse: for two important 
                                                decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at 
                                                the eye of all the important cultural storms. 
                                                He fathered quite a few of them.
                                                This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize 
                                                his work before suggesting a few (minor) 
                                                modifications to it.
                                                (1) Society consists of practices: economic, 
                                                political and ideological.
                                                Althusser defines a practice as:
                                                “Any process of transformation of a determinate
                                                product, affected
                                                by a determinate human labour, using determinate 
                                                means (of production)”
                                                The economic practice (the historically specific
                                                mode of production) transforms raw materials to
                                                finished products using human labour and other
                                                means of production, all organized within defined 
                                                webs of inter-relations. The political practice does
                                                the same with social relations as the raw materials. 
                                                Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way 
                                                that a subject relates to his real life 
                                                conditions of existence.
                                                This is a rejection of the mechanistic 
                                                worldview (replete with bases and superstructures).
                                                It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology.
                                                It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”.
                                                It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.
                                                In it, the very existence and reproduction of the social
                                                base (not merely its expression) is dependent upon 
                                                the social superstructure. The superstructure is 
                                                “relatively autonomous” and ideology has a central 
                                                part in it – see entry about Marx and Engels and 
                                                entry concerning Hegel.
                                                The economic structure is determinant but another 
                                                structure could be dominant, depending on the historical
                                                conjuncture. Determination (now called over-determination – 
                                                see Note) specifies the form of economic production 
                                                upon which the dominant practice depends.
                                                Put otherwise: the economic is determinant not 
                                                because the practices of the social formation 
                                                (political and ideological) are the social 
                                                formation’s expressive epiphenomena – but because
                                                it determines WHICH of them is dominant.
                                                (2) People relate to the conditions of 
                                                existence through the practice of ideology. 
                                                Contradictions are smoothed over and (real)
                                                problems are offered false (though seemingly true) solutions.
                                                Thus, ideology has a realistic dimension – and a dimension 
                                                of representations (myths, concepts, ideas, images). 
                                                There is (harsh, conflicting) reality – and the way
                                                that we represent it both to ourselves and to others.
                                                (3) To achieve the above, ideology must not be seen 
                                                to err or, worse, remain speechless. It, therefore, 
                                                confronts and poses (to itself) only answerable questions.
                                                This way, it remains confined to a fabulous, legendary,
                                                contradiction-free domain. It ignores other questions altogether.
                                                (4) Althusser introduced the concept of “The Problematic”:
                                                “The objective internal reference … the system of questions
                                                commanding the answers given”
                                                It determines which problems, questions and answers are
                                                part of the game – and which should be blacklisted and
                                                never as much as mentioned. It is a structure of theory 
                                                (ideology), a framework and the repertoire of discourses 
                                                which – ultimately – yield a text or a practice. 
                                                All the rest is excluded.
                                                It, therefore, becomes clear that what is omitted 
                                                is of no less importance than what is included in a text.
                                                The problematic of a text relates to its historical
                                                context (“moment”) by incorporating both: inclusions 
                                                as well as omissions, presences as much as absences. 
                                                The problematic of the text fosters the generation 
                                                of answers to posed questions – and of defective
                                                answers to excluded questions.
                                                (5) The task of “scientific” (e.g., Marxist) discourse,
                                                of Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct 
                                                the problematic, to read through ideology and 
                                                evidence the real conditions of existence.
                                                This is a “symptomatic reading” of TWO TEXTS:
                                                “It divulges the undivulged event in the text 
                                                that it reads and, in the
                                                same movement, relates to it a different text,
                                                present, as a necessary
                                                absence, in the first … (Marx’s reading of Adam Smith)
                                                presupposes
                                                the existence of two texts and the measurement
                                                of the first against
                                                the second. But what distinguishes this new
                                                reading from the old,
                                                is the fact that in the new one, the second 
                                                text is articulated with the
                                                lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) 
                                                the problematic contained
                                                in the paradox of an answer which does not
                                                correspond to any questions posed.”
                                                Althusser is contrasting the manifest 
                                                text with a latent text which is the result
                                                of the lapses, distortions, silences and
                                                absences in the manifest text. The latent 
                                                text is the “diary of the struggle” of the
                                                unposed question to be posed and answered.
                                                (6) Ideology is a practice with lived and 
                                                material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals,
                                                behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. 
                                                The State employs Ideological Apparatuses 
                                                (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices
                                                and productions: (organized) religion, the
                                                education system, the family, (organized) politics,
                                                the media, the industries of culture.
                                                “All ideology has the function (which defines it) 
                                                of ‘constructing’
                                                concrete individuals as subjects”
                                                Subjects to what? The answer: to the material
                                                practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects)
                                                is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”.
                                                These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , 
                                                forcing the individuals to generate meaning 
                                                (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                                                These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the
                                                Advertising and the film industries.
                                                The ideology of consumption (which is, undeniably, 
                                                the most material of all practices) uses 
                                                advertising to transform individuals to 
                                                subjects (=to consumers). It uses advertising
                                                to interpellate them. The advertisements
                                                attract attention, force people to introduce 
                                                meaning to them and, as a result, to consume.
                                                The most famous example is the use of “People
                                                like you (buy this or do that)” in ads. 
                                                The reader / viewer is interpellated both
                                                as an individual (“you”) and as a member of
                                                a group (“people like…”). He occupies the
                                                empty (imaginary) space of the “you” in the ad.
                                                This is ideological “misrecognition”. 
                                                First, many others misrecognize themselves 
                                                as that “you” (an impossibility in the real world).
                                                Secondly, the misrecognized “you” exists only 
                                                in the ad because it was created by it, it has
                                                no real world correlate.
                                                The reader or viewer of the ad is transformed 
                                                into the subject of (and subject to) the
                                                material practice of the ideology 
                                                (consumption, in this case).
                                                Althusser was a Marxist. The dominant 
                                                mode of production in his days (and even more so today)
                                                was capitalism. His implied criticism of 
                                                the material dimensions of ideological 
                                                practices should be taken with more than 
                                                a grain of salt. Interpellated by the 
                                                ideology of Marxism himself, he generalized 
                                                on his personal experience and described 
                                                ideologies as infallible, omnipotent, ever 
                                                successful. Ideologies, to him, were impeccably
                                                functioning machines which can always be
                                                relied upon to reproduce subjects with all 
                                                the habits and thought patterns required 
                                                by the dominant mode of production.
                                                And this is where Althusser fails, trapped
                                                by dogmatism and more than a touch of paranoia. 
                                                He neglects to treat two all-important 
                                                questions (his problematic may have not allowed it):
                                                (a) What do ideologies look for? Why do they
                                                engage in their practice? What is the ultimate goal?
                                                (b) What happens in a pluralistic environment
                                                rich in competing ideologies?
                                                Althusser stipulates the existence of two 
                                                texts, manifest and hidden. The latter 
                                                co-exists with the former, very much as
                                                a black figure defines its white background. 
                                                The background is also a figure and it is
                                                only arbitrarily – the result of historical
                                                conditioning – that we bestow a preferred 
                                                status upon the one. The latent text can be
                                                extracted from the manifest one by listening 
                                                to the absences, the lapses and the silences
                                                in the manifest text.
                                                But: what dictates the laws of extraction? 
                                                how do we know that the latent text thus 
                                                exposed is THE right one? Surely, there 
                                                must exist a procedure of comparison, 
                                                authentication and verification of the latent text?
                                                A comparison of the resulting latent text
                                                to the manifest text from which it was
                                                extracted would be futile because it would
                                                be recursive. This is not even a process 
                                                of iteration. It is teutological. There must
                                                exist a THIRD, “master-text”, a privileged text,
                                                historically invariant, reliable, unequivocal 
                                                (indifferent to interpretation-frameworks),
                                                universally accessible, atemporal and
                                                non-spatial. This third text is COMPLETE 
                                                in the sense that it includes both the 
                                                manifest and the latent. Actually, it should
                                                include all the possible texts (a LIBRARY function).
                                                The historical moment will determine which
                                                of them will be manifest and which latent, 
                                                according to the needs of the mode of 
                                                production and the various practices.
                                                Not all these texts will be conscious 
                                                and accessible to the individual but such 
                                                a text would embody and dictate the rules
                                                of comparison between the manifest text 
                                                and ITSELF (the Third Text) , being the COMPLETE text.
                                                Only through a comparison between a partial
                                                text and a complete text can the deficiencies
                                                of the partial text be exposed. A comparison
                                                between partial texts will yield no certain
                                                results and a comparison between the text 
                                                and itself (as Althusser suggests) is absolutely meaningless.
                                                This Third Text is the human psyche. 
                                                We constantly compare texts that we read 
                                                to this Third Text, a copy of which we all
                                                carry with us. We are unaware of most of 
                                                the texts incorporated in this master text of ours.
                                                When faced with a manifest text which is
                                                new to us, we first “download” the “rules 
                                                of comparison (engagement)”. We sift through 
                                                the manifest text. We compare it to our 
                                                COMPLETE master text and see which parts 
                                                are missing. These constitute the latent 
                                                text. The manifest text serves as a trigger 
                                                which brings to our consciousness appropriate
                                                and relevant portions of the Third Text. 
                                                It also generates the latent text in us.
                                                If this sounds familiar it is because this
                                                pattern of confronting (the manifest text),
                                                comparing (with our master text) and storing 
                                                the results (the latent text and the manifest
                                                text are brought to consciousness) – is used
                                                by mother nature itself. The DNA is such 
                                                a “Master Text, Third Text”. It includes 
                                                all the genetic-biological texts some manifest,
                                                some latent. Only stimuli in its environment
                                                (=a manifest text) can provoke it to generate
                                                its own (hitherto latent) “text”. The same would
                                                apply to computer applications.
                                                The Third Text, therefore, has an invariant
                                                nature (it includes all possible texts) – and,
                                                yet, is changeable by interacting with manifest texts.
                                                This contradiction is only apparent. The Third 
                                                Text does not change – only different parts of 
                                                it are brought to our awareness as a result of 
                                                the interaction with the manifest text. We can
                                                also safely say that one does not need to be 
                                                an Althusserian critic or engage in “scientific”
                                                discourse to deconstruct the problematic.
                                                Every reader of text immediately and always 
                                                deconstructs it. The very act of reading involves
                                                comparison with the Third Text which inevitably
                                                leads to the generation of a latent text.
                                                And this precisely is why some interpellations fail.
                                                The subject deconstructs every message even
                                                if he is not trained in critical practice.
                                                He is interpellated or fails to be interpellated
                                                depending on what latent message was generated
                                                through the comparison with the Third Text.
                                                And because the Third Text includes ALL possible
                                                texts, the subject is given to numerous 
                                                competing interpellations offered by many 
                                                ideologies, mostly at odds with each other.
                                                The subject is in an environment of COMPETING
                                                INTERPELLATIONS (especially in this day and
                                                age of information glut). The failure of 
                                                one interpellation – normally means the 
                                                success of another (whose interpellation 
                                                is based on the latent text generated in
                                                the comparison process or on a manifest 
                                                text of its own, or on a latent text generated by another text).
                                                There are competing ideologies even in the 
                                                most severe of authoritarian regimes. 
                                                Sometimes, IASs within the same social 
                                                formation offer competing ideologies: the 
                                                political Party, the Church, the Family,
                                                the Army, the Media, the Civilian Regime, 
                                                the Bureaucracy. To assume that interpellations
                                                are offered to the potential subjects 
                                                successively (and not in parallel) defies
                                                experience (though it does simplify the thought-system).
                                                Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.
                                                Advertising leads to the interpellation of the
                                                subject to effect the material practice of consumption.
                                                Put more simply: there is money involved. 
                                                Other ideologies – propagated through organized 
                                                religions, for instance – lead to prayer. 
                                                Could this be the material practice that 
                                                they are looking for? No way. Money, prayer,
                                                the very ability to interpellate – they are 
                                                all representations of power over other human beings.
                                                The business concern, the church, the political party,
                                                the family, the media, the culture industries – are all
                                                looking for the same thing: influence, power, might.
                                                Absurdly, interpellation is used to secure 
                                                one paramount thing: the ability to interpellate.
                                                Behind every material practice stands a psychological 
                                                practice (very much as the Third Text – the psyche – stands
                                                behind every text, latent or manifest).
                                                The media could be different: money, spiritual 
                                                prowess, physical brutality, subtle messages. 
                                                But everyone (even individuals in their private life) 
                                                is looking to hail and interpellate others and 
                                                thus manipulate them to succumb to their material practices.
                                                A short sighted view would say that the businessman 
                                                interpellates in order to make money.
                                                But the important question is: what ever for?
                                                What drives ideologies to establish material
                                                practices and to interpellate people to 
                                                participate in them and become subjects? 
                                                The will to power. the wish to be able to interpellate.
                                                It is this cyclical nature of Althusser’s 
                                                teachings (ideologies interpellate in order 
                                                to be able to interpellate) and his 
                                                dogmatic approach (ideologies never fail)
                                                which doomed his otherwise brilliant 
                                                observations to oblivion. In Althusser’s
                                                writings the Marxist determination remains 
                                                as Over-determination. This is a structured 
                                                articulation of a number of contradictions 
                                                and determinations (between the practices).
                                                This is very reminiscent of Freud’s Dream Theory
                                                and of the concept of Superposition in Quantum Mechanics.

                                        Motorhome or Trailer that is the question for you.
                                        Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages
                                        of both, so you will be confident when purchasing an RV.
                                        When comparing Rvs, a motorhome or a travel 
                                        trailer, should you buy a motorhome or fifth 
                                        wheeler? The advantages and disadvantages 
                                        of both are studied so that you can make 
                                        your choice wisely when purchasing an RV. 
                                        Possessing a motorhome or fifth wheel is 
                                        an achievement of a lifetime. It can be
                                        similar to sojourning with your residence 
                                        as you search the various sites of our great land, America.
                                        The two commonly known recreational vehicle
                                        classes are the motorized and towable. 
                                        Towable rvs are the travel trailers and 
                                        the fifth wheel. The rv travel trailer 
                                        or fifth wheel has the attraction of getting
                                        towed by a pickup or a car, thus giving 
                                        the adaptability of possessing transportation
                                        for you when you are parked at your campsite. 
                                        A motorhome is a recreational vehicle that
                                        is motorized. It has three categories which
                                        can either be gas, diesel or Diesel Pushers 
                                        which are the most costly ones. Converted 
                                        vans that are large and self-sustaining 
                                        represent the smaller types of motorhomes
                                        and then there are the ones that are built 
                                        on the chassis of a truck.. The motorized
                                        motor home needs a tow car for your transportation 
                                        after you set up in your campsite.
                                        Rvs are styled to your specifications for 
                                        the best appearance and luxuries you 
                                        anticipate when possessing an rv. 
                                        High standard artisanship, venues for 
                                        entertainment, and keenness to small
                                        bits of information can be applied into
                                        an rv bearing in mind that each and every 
                                        amenity comes with a price tag.
                                        A travel trailer or fifth wheel is larger
                                        inside than a motorhome of the same size 
                                        because of the driving area, i.e. a 40 foot 
                                        trailer or fifth wheel has more livable 
                                        space than a 40 foot motorhome. 
                                        Towing a trailer with a car puts a lot of 
                                        wear and tear on the automobile because 
                                        they are usually not equipped for heavy duty towing.
                                        The motor home is definitely more money 
                                        because you are paying for the driving 
                                        mechanism and chassis. Trailers and motorhomes
                                        can be equipped with the same options. 
                                        So the question seems to be do I want to 
                                        travel in a truck pulling a large fifth 
                                        wheel or ride in a motorhome pulling a tow car.
                                        One thing is certain if you talk to a 
                                        motorhome owner he will tell you that you 
                                        should definitely purchase a motorhome 
                                        and the same goes for a travel trailer or
                                        fifth wheel owner, he thinks the trailer 
                                        is the only way to go.  No matter what you 
                                        choose the experiences are out of this world.

                                        This is a popular question people ask me. 
                                        How do you know if I am mastering the art 
                                        of Deliberate Attraction? Is there an advanced

                                        “The application of this material into your daily 
                                        life IS the advanced course!” To help you gauge
                                        where you’re at in the mastery of Law of Attraction,
                                        I’ve compiled a list of seven sure-fire 
                                        ways to tell if YOU are joining the thousands 
                                        of people who really are mastering this stuff.
                                        7 TOP indicators that I am mastering Law of Attraction
                                        1. I understand and accept that Law of 
                                        Attraction is a process. It is a process 
                                        of gradually reducing the negative vibrational
                                        patterns I have towards some areas in my
                                        life and replacing them with positive thoughts.
                                        Through the intentional and deliberate use of 
                                        the tools of Law of Attraction, I see 
                                        evidence that my allowing is gradually increasing.
                                        2. Over time I am seeing some behavioural 
                                        changes in myself. Even though I constantly
                                        hear others using don’t, not and no I have
                                        eventually stopped using these words out loud.
                                        Each time I catch myself even thinking these
                                        words, I automatically ask myself the question,
                                        “So what DO I want?” I know that when I change
                                        my words, my vibration changes and I can 
                                        only hold one vibration at a time.
                                        3. I’ve noticed over time that I am observing
                                        contrast (anything that doesn’t feel good to me) 
                                        more and more briefly.
                                        4. I’ve noticed that I am having fewer
                                        and fewer experiences of negative people
                                        and events in my life. 5. It’s become
                                        second nature for me to be aware of many
                                        , many more things that I can appreciate
                                        and express gratitude for.
                                        6. I find myself automatically assigning 
                                        all my new desires to Law of Attraction.
                                        When I want something new in my life 
                                        I say, “I’m using Law of Attraction to get that!”
                                        7. I understand the expression I get what
                                        I vibrate and I hold myself fully accountable
                                        for everything that shows up in my life,
                                        both positive and negative!

                                        on the deck of your home or having a powerful

                                        of astronomy because the joy of what we
                                        do as star gazers is a big part of the appeal.
                                        But unlike many other hobbies, ours is a 
                                        passion of science, of learning and of discovery.
                                        And don’t kid yourself, even a hobbyist with
                                        a limited telescopic set up can see some 
                                        amazing things in the stars. So let’s be sure
                                        you invest in a solid piece of equipment 
                                        that you can continue to grow with as your
                                        knowledge and ability as an astronomer grows.
                                        But how do we do that?
                                        Meet the Geeks.
                                        Now we use the term “telescope geeks” lovingly
                                        because any of us who are devoted to our love
                                        of astronomy eventually become telescope geeks.
                                        And these are the type of people who will know 
                                        exactly how to evaluate your needs in terms 
                                        of where you are right now and where you want
                                        to go as your hobby grows with you. So if 
                                        you have not yet associated with a local 
                                        astronomy club, now is the time to do it. 
                                        Start rubbing elbows with people who live
                                        and breathe telescopes. Their input is a 
                                        hundred times more reliable than what a 
                                        sales brochure or that salesman might have 
                                        to say because the “telescope geeks” have
                                        been where you are, made the mistakes and
                                        are eager to help you avoid those same mistakes.
                                        Size Matters
                                        In the world of telescopes, the sales people
                                        see, to try to baffle us with all the bells
                                        and whistles of their hottest selling model.
                                        One of the big check points that is often 
                                        pushed is the amplification level of the 
                                        telescope lens. While that is a factor that
                                        is worth noting, when it comes to a telescope 
                                        lens, the old phrase “size matters” is a good guideline.
                                        Just remember that your telescope lens works
                                        best when it takes in the most light it 
                                        can from the object you are viewing. 
                                        So the wider the diameter of the lens,
                                        the better a view you are going to get.
                                        So don’t fall for the amplification level only.
                                        Carefully evaluate the lens size so you
                                        have the right fit for what you want to do.
                                        It Has to Stand on Its Own Feet.
                                        If you are going to set up a permanent
                                        telescope station, then you can bolt the
                                        unit down so it is well supported. But many 
                                        of us have to take our telescopes out into 
                                        the country for optimum use. So the stand
                                        has to be strong and flexible so we can 
                                        set up the telescope on uneven turf but 
                                        still feel secure that this important and 
                                        expensive piece of equipment is going to
                                        stand on its own without fear of it falling 
                                        during our observation time. 
                                        We already mentioned strong and flexible 
                                        as evaluation guides for the telescope 
                                        stand but add in ease of use as well. 
                                        You have to be able to set your telescope
                                        up and break it down quickly and easily 
                                        when you are on a remote viewing. You may
                                        even find yourself setting up or taking
                                        down your telescope in the dark or by lantern
                                        or flashlight if you are taking advantage 
                                        of the great star displays in the late night
                                        sky that make this hobby so exciting. 
                                        These are the basics of what to look for 
                                        in your new telescope. Finally, make sure 
                                        the telescope can be enhanced and expanded
                                        without having to throw the first unit away
                                        and buy something completely new. You want
                                        your telescope to grow as your knowledge 
                                        and skills grow. If your first telescope 
                                        meets all of these requirements, you are 
                                        off on the right foot on a long and enjoyable
                                        career as an amateur astronomer.
