                                            on the gamblers life and despite feelings 
                                            of guilt and remorse. Problem gambling tends to
                                            have a negative effect on the gamblers financial 
                                            state, relationships and daily life. Severe 
                                            cases of problem gambling can be defined as 
                                            pathological gambling. Am I a Compulsive Gambler?
                                            1) Do you gamble until your last penny runs out?
                                            2) Do you gamble to win back your former losses or debts?
                                            3) Did you ever had to borrow money to continue gamble?
                                            4) Did your gambling habit ever made you lie to your friends or family?
                                            5) Did you ever skip work or other obligation to gamble?
                                            6) Do you tend to gamble to forget about your personal 
                                            problems or to celebrate happy occasions?
                                            7) Does gambling have a negative affect on your 
                                            daily life or relationships?
                                            If you have answered yes on at least one of the 
                                            questions listed above, then you have a problem.
                                            Can Anyone Become a Compulsive Gambler?
                                            Theoretically, yes. Any gambler can develop g
                                            ambling problem regardless to the type of
                                            gambling he is occupied with, the amount 
                                            of money and time he is spending on gambling. 
                                            Researches show that slot machines that can 
                                            be found in bars and convenient stores are 
                                            the most addictive type of gambling activity, 
                                            while lottery draws and bingo games are located 
                                            on the other end of the scale. Gambling addiction 
                                            is an emotional problem; its symptoms, causes and
                                            treatments are similar to any other form of addiction. 
                                            How Can I treat Gambling Addiction?
                                            1) Group Therapy:
                                            Gamblers Anonymous offers a 12 step self help 
                                            program similar to the one offered to alcohol
                                            addicts in Alcoholics Anonymous. Group therapy 
                                            also offers gambling addicts advice and support
                                            from professional counselors and other 
                                            gambling addicts in different phases of their
                                            recovery process. Gambler Anonymous centers 
                                            are available in more than 1,200 locations statewide.
                                            2) Individual Therapy:
                                            Cognitive or behavior therapy can help gambling
                                            addicts to identify their unaware thinking 
                                            and acting patterns, which led them to gamble
                                            compulsively, and to replace them with 
                                            controllable and healthier ways of thinking.
                                            3) Psychiatric Medication:
                                            It has recently been proven that antidepressant
                                            medications from the family of SSRIs, selective
                                            serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be affective 
                                            in treatment of gambling addicts.

                                                “An end to all wars”. Those wishes, while exemplary,
                                                are meaningless. As long as humans exist there 
                                                will never be peace on earth. Throughout the history
                                                of humankind there has never been peace on earth. 
                                                Cavemen fought other cavemen over territory, food 
                                                and even women. Cain killed Abel over God’s respect.
                                                Gabriel blew down the walls of Jericho. America 
                                                fought the Revolutionary War for freedom and brother 
                                                fought against brother in our Civil War for more freedom.
                                                There have always been wars and there will always be wars. 
                                                As long as humans can think, there will be wars. Wars over 
                                                such concepts as freedom, honor, dignity, etc.. Wars over
                                                territory, greed, power, prejudice, etc.. War is a part 
                                                of human nature. For example, every human being is prejudiced.
                                                If they don’t like some race, nationality or religion, 
                                                they don’t like short or tall or fat or skinny or smart
                                                or not smart or loud or quiet people. Some people don’t like
                                                children, some people don’t like old people, some people 
                                                don’t like people with pets, or people that play their music
                                                too loud, or bad drivers, or people that believe in God or
                                                people that don’t believe in God. What is right and proper 
                                                to some people can be wrong or even enraging to other people. 
                                                Religion can not stop wars, in fact many wars are fought 
                                                over religion (Note: I believe that religion is used as 
                                                an excuse for war not the real reason for war.). Christians 
                                                fought against Muslims during the Crusades, Many Muslims want 
                                                death for all non believers. The Catholic Church killed heretics
                                                during the Inquisition. The Nazis killed millions of Jews and 
                                                then started killing Catholics. The Russians under Stalin 
                                                killed anyone even remotly religious. Protestants killed other 
                                                Protestants for being the wrong type of Protestant. Muslims killed
                                                Muslims for being the wrong type of Muslim. Don’t forget about 
                                                Atheists (I believe that Atheism is also a religion, it is a 
                                                religion of non belief.), Stalin was an Atheist and wanted to
                                                get rid of all religion. Most of China’s leaders are Atheists 
                                                and have jailed and killed huge numbers of religious people. 
                                                History is rife with various types of religious battles. 
                                                The main reason for war, however, is the lust for power. 
                                                The power to make others do and believe as you do and believe,
                                                the power to make other people render unto you what you believe
                                                is rightfully yours, the power to make other people treat you 
                                                as you believe you should be treated, the power to gain what 
                                                you want (ie: money, love, respect, etc.), the power to punish 
                                                others for doing things that you don’t believe they should do, 
                                                the power to keep other from having things or thoughts that 
                                                you don’t have. In other words, the power to be, in some ways 
                                                God, to make everyone else in your image with you as their ruler.
                                                As long as people have the ability to think, there will be greed, 
                                                envy, prejudice and anger. As long as those things exist, 
                                                there will be wars. Most people believe, either religiously 
                                                or secularly, in the rules set down in the Ten Commandments, 
                                                but very few people can follow those rules all of the time
                                                because our ability to think causes us to want. Wanting causes 
                                                us to break some or all of the rules. Humans are not perfect. 
                                                If they were they would not be human.

                                                With the exception of Nietzsche, no other madman
                                                has contributed so much to human sanity as has 
                                                Louis Althusser. He is mentioned twice in the 
                                                Encyclopaedia Britannica as someone’s teacher. 
                                                There could be no greater lapse: for two important 
                                                decades (the 60s and the 70s), Althusser was at 
                                                the eye of all the important cultural storms. 
                                                He fathered quite a few of them.
                                                This newly-found obscurity forces me to summarize 
                                                his work before suggesting a few (minor) 
                                                modifications to it.
                                                (1) Society consists of practices: economic, 
                                                political and ideological.
                                                Althusser defines a practice as:
                                                “Any process of transformation of a determinate
                                                product, affected
                                                by a determinate human labour, using determinate 
                                                means (of production)”
                                                The economic practice (the historically specific
                                                mode of production) transforms raw materials to
                                                finished products using human labour and other
                                                means of production, all organized within defined 
                                                webs of inter-relations. The political practice does
                                                the same with social relations as the raw materials. 
                                                Finally, ideology is the transformation of the way 
                                                that a subject relates to his real life 
                                                conditions of existence.
                                                This is a rejection of the mechanistic 
                                                worldview (replete with bases and superstructures).
                                                It is a rejection of the Marxist theorization of ideology.
                                                It is a rejection of the Hegelian fascist “social totality”.
                                                It is a dynamic, revealing, modern day model.
                                                In it, the very existence and reproduction of the social
                                                base (not merely its expression) is dependent upon 
                                                the social superstructure. The superstructure is 
                                                “relatively autonomous” and ideology has a central 
                                                part in it – see entry about Marx and Engels and 
                                                entry concerning Hegel.
                                                The economic structure is determinant but another 
                                                structure could be dominant, depending on the historical
                                                conjuncture. Determination (now called over-determination – 
                                                see Note) specifies the form of economic production 
                                                upon which the dominant practice depends.
                                                Put otherwise: the economic is determinant not 
                                                because the practices of the social formation 
                                                (political and ideological) are the social 
                                                formation’s expressive epiphenomena – but because
                                                it determines WHICH of them is dominant.
                                                (2) People relate to the conditions of 
                                                existence through the practice of ideology. 
                                                Contradictions are smoothed over and (real)
                                                problems are offered false (though seemingly true) solutions.
                                                Thus, ideology has a realistic dimension – and a dimension 
                                                of representations (myths, concepts, ideas, images). 
                                                There is (harsh, conflicting) reality – and the way
                                                that we represent it both to ourselves and to others.
                                                (3) To achieve the above, ideology must not be seen 
                                                to err or, worse, remain speechless. It, therefore, 
                                                confronts and poses (to itself) only answerable questions.
                                                This way, it remains confined to a fabulous, legendary,
                                                contradiction-free domain. It ignores other questions altogether.
                                                (4) Althusser introduced the concept of “The Problematic”:
                                                “The objective internal reference … the system of questions
                                                commanding the answers given”
                                                It determines which problems, questions and answers are
                                                part of the game – and which should be blacklisted and
                                                never as much as mentioned. It is a structure of theory 
                                                (ideology), a framework and the repertoire of discourses 
                                                which – ultimately – yield a text or a practice. 
                                                All the rest is excluded.
                                                It, therefore, becomes clear that what is omitted 
                                                is of no less importance than what is included in a text.
                                                The problematic of a text relates to its historical
                                                context (“moment”) by incorporating both: inclusions 
                                                as well as omissions, presences as much as absences. 
                                                The problematic of the text fosters the generation 
                                                of answers to posed questions – and of defective
                                                answers to excluded questions.
                                                (5) The task of “scientific” (e.g., Marxist) discourse,
                                                of Althusserian critical practice is to deconstruct 
                                                the problematic, to read through ideology and 
                                                evidence the real conditions of existence.
                                                This is a “symptomatic reading” of TWO TEXTS:
                                                “It divulges the undivulged event in the text 
                                                that it reads and, in the
                                                same movement, relates to it a different text,
                                                present, as a necessary
                                                absence, in the first … (Marx’s reading of Adam Smith)
                                                presupposes
                                                the existence of two texts and the measurement
                                                of the first against
                                                the second. But what distinguishes this new
                                                reading from the old,
                                                is the fact that in the new one, the second 
                                                text is articulated with the
                                                lapses in the first text … (Marx measures) 
                                                the problematic contained
                                                in the paradox of an answer which does not
                                                correspond to any questions posed.”
                                                Althusser is contrasting the manifest 
                                                text with a latent text which is the result
                                                of the lapses, distortions, silences and
                                                absences in the manifest text. The latent 
                                                text is the “diary of the struggle” of the
                                                unposed question to be posed and answered.
                                                (6) Ideology is a practice with lived and 
                                                material dimensions. It has costumes, rituals,
                                                behaviour patterns, ways of thinking. 
                                                The State employs Ideological Apparatuses 
                                                (ISAs) to reproduce ideology through practices
                                                and productions: (organized) religion, the
                                                education system, the family, (organized) politics,
                                                the media, the industries of culture.
                                                “All ideology has the function (which defines it) 
                                                of ‘constructing’
                                                concrete individuals as subjects”
                                                Subjects to what? The answer: to the material
                                                practices of the ideology. This (the creation of subjects)
                                                is done by the acts of “hailing” or “interpellation”.
                                                These are acts of attracting attention (hailing) , 
                                                forcing the individuals to generate meaning 
                                                (interpretation) and making them participate in the practice.
                                                These theoretical tools were widely used to analyze the
                                                Advertising and the film industries.
                                                The ideology of consumption (which is, undeniably, 
                                                the most material of all practices) uses 
                                                advertising to transform individuals to 
                                                subjects (=to consumers). It uses advertising
                                                to interpellate them. The advertisements
                                                attract attention, force people to introduce 
                                                meaning to them and, as a result, to consume.
                                                The most famous example is the use of “People
                                                like you (buy this or do that)” in ads. 
                                                The reader / viewer is interpellated both
                                                as an individual (“you”) and as a member of
                                                a group (“people like…”). He occupies the
                                                empty (imaginary) space of the “you” in the ad.
                                                This is ideological “misrecognition”. 
                                                First, many others misrecognize themselves 
                                                as that “you” (an impossibility in the real world).
                                                Secondly, the misrecognized “you” exists only 
                                                in the ad because it was created by it, it has
                                                no real world correlate.
                                                The reader or viewer of the ad is transformed 
                                                into the subject of (and subject to) the
                                                material practice of the ideology 
                                                (consumption, in this case).
                                                Althusser was a Marxist. The dominant 
                                                mode of production in his days (and even more so today)
                                                was capitalism. His implied criticism of 
                                                the material dimensions of ideological 
                                                practices should be taken with more than 
                                                a grain of salt. Interpellated by the 
                                                ideology of Marxism himself, he generalized 
                                                on his personal experience and described 
                                                ideologies as infallible, omnipotent, ever 
                                                successful. Ideologies, to him, were impeccably
                                                functioning machines which can always be
                                                relied upon to reproduce subjects with all 
                                                the habits and thought patterns required 
                                                by the dominant mode of production.
                                                And this is where Althusser fails, trapped
                                                by dogmatism and more than a touch of paranoia. 
                                                He neglects to treat two all-important 
                                                questions (his problematic may have not allowed it):
                                                (a) What do ideologies look for? Why do they
                                                engage in their practice? What is the ultimate goal?
                                                (b) What happens in a pluralistic environment
                                                rich in competing ideologies?
                                                Althusser stipulates the existence of two 
                                                texts, manifest and hidden. The latter 
                                                co-exists with the former, very much as
                                                a black figure defines its white background. 
                                                The background is also a figure and it is
                                                only arbitrarily – the result of historical
                                                conditioning – that we bestow a preferred 
                                                status upon the one. The latent text can be
                                                extracted from the manifest one by listening 
                                                to the absences, the lapses and the silences
                                                in the manifest text.
                                                But: what dictates the laws of extraction? 
                                                how do we know that the latent text thus 
                                                exposed is THE right one? Surely, there 
                                                must exist a procedure of comparison, 
                                                authentication and verification of the latent text?
                                                A comparison of the resulting latent text
                                                to the manifest text from which it was
                                                extracted would be futile because it would
                                                be recursive. This is not even a process 
                                                of iteration. It is teutological. There must
                                                exist a THIRD, “master-text”, a privileged text,
                                                historically invariant, reliable, unequivocal 
                                                (indifferent to interpretation-frameworks),
                                                universally accessible, atemporal and
                                                non-spatial. This third text is COMPLETE 
                                                in the sense that it includes both the 
                                                manifest and the latent. Actually, it should
                                                include all the possible texts (a LIBRARY function).
                                                The historical moment will determine which
                                                of them will be manifest and which latent, 
                                                according to the needs of the mode of 
                                                production and the various practices.
                                                Not all these texts will be conscious 
                                                and accessible to the individual but such 
                                                a text would embody and dictate the rules
                                                of comparison between the manifest text 
                                                and ITSELF (the Third Text) , being the COMPLETE text.
                                                Only through a comparison between a partial
                                                text and a complete text can the deficiencies
                                                of the partial text be exposed. A comparison
                                                between partial texts will yield no certain
                                                results and a comparison between the text 
                                                and itself (as Althusser suggests) is absolutely meaningless.
                                                This Third Text is the human psyche. 
                                                We constantly compare texts that we read 
                                                to this Third Text, a copy of which we all
                                                carry with us. We are unaware of most of 
                                                the texts incorporated in this master text of ours.
                                                When faced with a manifest text which is
                                                new to us, we first “download” the “rules 
                                                of comparison (engagement)”. We sift through 
                                                the manifest text. We compare it to our 
                                                COMPLETE master text and see which parts 
                                                are missing. These constitute the latent 
                                                text. The manifest text serves as a trigger 
                                                which brings to our consciousness appropriate
                                                and relevant portions of the Third Text. 
                                                It also generates the latent text in us.
                                                If this sounds familiar it is because this
                                                pattern of confronting (the manifest text),
                                                comparing (with our master text) and storing 
                                                the results (the latent text and the manifest
                                                text are brought to consciousness) – is used
                                                by mother nature itself. The DNA is such 
                                                a “Master Text, Third Text”. It includes 
                                                all the genetic-biological texts some manifest,
                                                some latent. Only stimuli in its environment
                                                (=a manifest text) can provoke it to generate
                                                its own (hitherto latent) “text”. The same would
                                                apply to computer applications.
                                                The Third Text, therefore, has an invariant
                                                nature (it includes all possible texts) – and,
                                                yet, is changeable by interacting with manifest texts.
                                                This contradiction is only apparent. The Third 
                                                Text does not change – only different parts of 
                                                it are brought to our awareness as a result of 
                                                the interaction with the manifest text. We can
                                                also safely say that one does not need to be 
                                                an Althusserian critic or engage in “scientific”
                                                discourse to deconstruct the problematic.
                                                Every reader of text immediately and always 
                                                deconstructs it. The very act of reading involves
                                                comparison with the Third Text which inevitably
                                                leads to the generation of a latent text.
                                                And this precisely is why some interpellations fail.
                                                The subject deconstructs every message even
                                                if he is not trained in critical practice.
                                                He is interpellated or fails to be interpellated
                                                depending on what latent message was generated
                                                through the comparison with the Third Text.
                                                And because the Third Text includes ALL possible
                                                texts, the subject is given to numerous 
                                                competing interpellations offered by many 
                                                ideologies, mostly at odds with each other.
                                                The subject is in an environment of COMPETING
                                                INTERPELLATIONS (especially in this day and
                                                age of information glut). The failure of 
                                                one interpellation – normally means the 
                                                success of another (whose interpellation 
                                                is based on the latent text generated in
                                                the comparison process or on a manifest 
                                                text of its own, or on a latent text generated by another text).
                                                There are competing ideologies even in the 
                                                most severe of authoritarian regimes. 
                                                Sometimes, IASs within the same social 
                                                formation offer competing ideologies: the 
                                                political Party, the Church, the Family,
                                                the Army, the Media, the Civilian Regime, 
                                                the Bureaucracy. To assume that interpellations
                                                are offered to the potential subjects 
                                                successively (and not in parallel) defies
                                                experience (though it does simplify the thought-system).
                                                Clarifying the HOW, though, does not shed light on the WHY.
                                                Advertising leads to the interpellation of the
                                                subject to effect the material practice of consumption.
                                                Put more simply: there is money involved. 
                                                Other ideologies – propagated through organized 
                                                religions, for instance – lead to prayer. 
                                                Could this be the material practice that 
                                                they are looking for? No way. Money, prayer,
                                                the very ability to interpellate – they are 
                                                all representations of power over other human beings.
                                                The business concern, the church, the political party,
                                                the family, the media, the culture industries – are all
                                                looking for the same thing: influence, power, might.
                                                Absurdly, interpellation is used to secure 
                                                one paramount thing: the ability to interpellate.
                                                Behind every material practice stands a psychological 
                                                practice (very much as the Third Text – the psyche – stands
                                                behind every text, latent or manifest).
                                                The media could be different: money, spiritual 
                                                prowess, physical brutality, subtle messages. 
                                                But everyone (even individuals in their private life) 
                                                is looking to hail and interpellate others and 
                                                thus manipulate them to succumb to their material practices.
                                                A short sighted view would say that the businessman 
                                                interpellates in order to make money.
                                                But the important question is: what ever for?
                                                What drives ideologies to establish material
                                                practices and to interpellate people to 
                                                participate in them and become subjects? 
                                                The will to power. the wish to be able to interpellate.
                                                It is this cyclical nature of Althusser’s 
                                                teachings (ideologies interpellate in order 
                                                to be able to interpellate) and his 
                                                dogmatic approach (ideologies never fail)
                                                which doomed his otherwise brilliant 
                                                observations to oblivion. In Althusser’s
                                                writings the Marxist determination remains 
                                                as Over-determination. This is a structured 
                                                articulation of a number of contradictions 
                                                and determinations (between the practices).
                                                This is very reminiscent of Freud’s Dream Theory
                                                and of the concept of Superposition in Quantum Mechanics.

                                        tips can help a host put together an extraordinary 
                                        event for family and friends. Eating outdoors 
                                        is a favorite pastime enjoyed by everyone 
                                        and planning the event can help make it more
                                        memorable and stress-free for the host. 
                                        Big or small, a barbecue party requires 
                                        an adequate amount of planning and preparation
                                        to ensure that everything is laid out properly.
                                        It is advisable to plan the event around
                                        a theme in order to create a focal point 
                                        for the barbecue party. This way, all 
                                        aspects of the party such as the food, 
                                        games and decorations can be fashioned around 
                                        a central theme. Favorite themes for barbecue
                                        parties include a Hawaiian motif, nostalgic 
                                        seventies get-together, or, if you are near
                                        the sea, opt for a beach bbq party!
                                        Planning the menu is perhaps the most important
                                        part of any get-together especially for a barbecue
                                        party as most guests will be looking forward to 
                                        an array of lip-smacking roasted meats dripping in bbq sauce.
                                        Barbecue on the Beach Anyone?
                                        Ah, what can be better than a great barbecue
                                        on the beach? The beach is definitely one 
                                        of the best locations to have a barbecue. 
                                        After all, the nature of grilling and barbecuing 
                                        as a cooking technique is that it’s fun, 
                                        exciting and very rewarding. Similarly,
                                        the beach pretty much exudes the same atmosphere.
                                        There are a lot of fun and exciting activities 
                                        to do at the beach. It’s a place where people
                                        can be themselves in their ‘bare essentials’
                                        and the relaxation factor is definitely rewarding. 
                                        Putting these two wonderful concepts together,
                                        a barbecue on the beach is pretty much a recipe for a great time!
                                        But before you pack your stuff, gear up your
                                        grill and hit the sand for one hell of a barbecue
                                        on the beach party, bear in mind that there 
                                        are various safety procedures and other rules
                                        governing beach areas so it would be best to 
                                        consult authorities and secure the proper
                                        permissions before you even think about 
                                        organizing a beach barbecue party.
                                        Assuming you’ve done that and you’ve already
                                        picked a nice spot, next would be preparing 
                                        for your barbecue on the beach. There are 
                                        various grill types that you may use for 
                                        barbecuing on the beach – you have the
                                        wood or charcoal grill, gas grill or you
                                        may also use a campfire tripod. Be sure 
                                        to station your grill in a stable spot, 
                                        away from any flammable material and safe 
                                        from people possibly bumping into it.
                                        Bring your marinated meat, poultry or 
                                        seafood in a cooler and take them out only 
                                        when you’re ready to start barbecuing to
                                        avoid spoilage. Further, the last seasoning
                                        you would want on your barbecue on the beach
                                        is sand right? So keep them covered!
                                        And of course, don’t forget to pack those 
                                        barbecue sauces and hot sauces to spice up
                                        your barbecue dishes. If you’re looking for 
                                        something insanely different to give your

                                        When it comes to buying good cookware, 
                                        there are a lot of different options. 
                                        Some people like to buy a matched set of 
                                        cookware, but seasoned cooks often like 
                                        to mix and match making an eclectic set 
                                        that assures them the perfect finish to 
                                        every dish they create.

                                        Motivation can take you far, but it can
                                        take you even further if you first find your vision.
                                        Your vision will motivate and guide you
                                        on your journey to success and personal fullfillment.
                                        Trying to succeed at anything without 
                                        first having a clear vision of what it is you 
                                        want to accomplish will only lead to you 
                                        going around in circles and eventually giving
                                        up in frustration.  To develop your vision,
                                        you must look inside yourself. Vision comes
                                        from within, from the spirit or subconscious,
                                        whatever you choose to call it. Every one has 
                                        a vision that is uniquely their own, and you
                                        are no different. the hard part comes in
                                        understanding your personal vision and how 
                                        it applies to your personal motivation plan. 
                                        Your vision will most likely not come suddenly
                                        like some bolt of lightning out of the sky.
                                        Instead, it will grow from your experiences, 
                                        talents, dreams, and desires, so don’t try to rush it.
                                        Instead, keep your motivation and allow your vision 
                                        to reveal itself through you.  Here are five 
                                        steps you can use to effectively find 
                                        your vision:  1. Learn to listen to your inner voice.
                                        Since your vision starts from inside you, you should
                                        learn to listen and feel what your mind and 
                                        heart truly desire. What stirs you? What is your 
                                        greatest desire? What kind of dreams do you have? 
                                        If what you think you want does not really come
                                        from the inner depths of your heart and soul, 
                                        then you will find it difficult, if not impossible,
                                        to not give up before you achieve it. 
                                        2. Prepare yourself mentally. Your vision begins 
                                        in your mind and heart. It is something that 
                                        burns within your soul. it should be greater 
                                        than your all of your past memories, mistakes,
                                        and accomplishments. If you know what your
                                        vision is, you will have a purpose and won’t 
                                        get lost on your journey. Discouragement is 
                                        the outcome of not having a ditinct vision. 
                                        If you don’t know where you’re going or how to
                                        get there, the journey will seem a lot longer and harder. 
                                        In order to seek your vision, retreat to a 
                                        quiet and tranquil place, a place that will 
                                        allow your mind to think creatively and
                                        concentrate on your vision.  
                                        3. Seek out other motivated vision seekers.
                                        Greatness breeds greatness, and it is for
                                        this reason that you should seek out the 
                                        company of others who can appreciate and 
                                        support your vision. Hang with the winners 
                                        and it will keep your motivation high. 
                                        4. Keep a notebook and pen handy. All too often,
                                        when seeking a vision, it is easy to forget
                                        that it is 90 percent inspiration, as American 
                                        inventor Thomas Edison said. With that in mind,
                                        you never know when your vision is going to
                                        come to fruition, so keep a small notebook 
                                        with you at all times, even on your nightstand
                                        when you sleep, and write down whatever 
                                        comes to mind, no matter how silly it seems 
                                        at the time. You may write down a hundred 
                                        crazy ideas but number one hundred and one
                                        just might be the vision you were searching for.
                                        Don’t try to edit right now, just write down 
                                        everything that comes to mind.   
                                        5. Don’t try to fully understand your vision.
                                        The vision you are seeking will most likely
                                        come to you in ways that you won’t fully 
                                        understand at the moment. That’s okay.
                                        Just follow as much of your vision as you 
                                        can right now, and more will be revealed
                                        to you as time goes on.   All truly successful
                                        people have a vision that they follow, 
                                        no matter what challenges they may face, 
                                        to it’s eventual outcome. Begin following 
                                        the above steps to seek your vision today 
                                        and remember that true, lasting success will
                                        never come to you until you know what your 
                                        vision is and how you will follow it. And you
                                        will be unstoppable if you combine your personal
                                        vision with a healthy dose of motivation.

                                        Many people has the notion that enlightenment is one state.
                                        Many also believe that when it is attained, 
                                        a person is forever in that state.
                                        The following is not a definitive article
                                        on this subject. It is just an expression
                                        of my own thoughts.
                                        My opinion is that enlightenment is not
                                        just one state but is a progressive and 
                                        gradual establishing of states of consciousness.
                                        I, myself have not reach the end of the road. 
                                        But from years on a spiritual quest, 
                                        I can safely say that enlightenment happens
                                        in a series or stages of self-realisations and self-discoveries.
                                        Usually there is a difference between an 
                                        initial awakening and a later stabilisation 
                                        of that stage that happens through practice or experiences. 
                                        The initial awakenings are new discoveries 
                                        about the dynamics of consciousness, while 
                                        the stabilisation is the assimilation of
                                        what is being discovered into one’s life experience.
                                        Sometimes, a new discovery can completely 
                                        over-rule or modify upon an older one.
                                        Almost all stages of enlightenment can be 
                                        said to be associated with Presence. 
                                        However, the enlightening Presence comes in 
                                        various degrees of intensity and clarity. 
                                        The degree of intensity is directly dependent 
                                        on the level and depth of one’s clarity as 
                                        well as one’s realisations/discoveries.
                                        Also, as one progresses along, the relationship 
                                        or connections of oneself to the universe and 
                                        existence at large also becomes clearer.
                                        Below very briefly illustrates the progressive 
                                        and stage-based nature of enlightenment:
                                        When one first begin meditating, one may first
                                        experience the all-pervading Presence. 
                                        This Presence, is most often experienced 
                                        when thoughts are momentarily suspended.
                                        This Presence which exists in the Eternal 
                                        Present Moment is our true self.
                                        However such an experience can only be 
                                        classified as an awakening to the true self..
                                        which is no-self. This is because, after the meditation, 
                                        the Presence seems to have disappeared. 
                                        One cannot understand and find the connection 
                                        of presence to our everyday life. Therefore 
                                        one will have difficulty re-acquiring the Presence.
                                        And it takes many stages and series of realisation
                                        to understand the relationship of Presence to our 
                                        phenomenal world. It can be said that the prolonged 
                                        sustaining of Presence is dependent on the stages
                                        and depth of realisation.
                                        Also, during the earlier stages we may mistaken
                                        another state to be the pure presence.
                                        For example, we may mistaken ‘I AM’ for pure presence. 
                                        This is because the thinking mind has 
                                        created a reflective image of Pure Presence.
                                        This reflection of the absolute is ‘I AM’.
                                        Usually, in order to pass through the ‘I AM’
                                        stage, the person must move unto even deeper
                                        understandings. These understandings may 
                                        include realising that one’s personality is
                                        not the doer of action. This stage may persist
                                        for a while before the person realises the 
                                        illusion of subject-object division. 
                                        This stage involves recognising the hypnotic 
                                        impression of there being an observer and
                                        the being observed. Here is where one begins
                                        to see through the illusionary nature of our phenomenal world.
                                        I cannot comment on the stages before me 
                                        as they are beyond me. Nevertheless, one 
                                        can still see from the above description 
                                        that enlightenment is not so straight-forward after all.
                                        For your necessary discernment. Thank you for reading.

                                        For more than 10 years, Beth McFadden,
                                        a 44-year- old mother of three, lived 
                                        with strange leg sensations that were not
                                        only difficult to describe, but were also
                                        uncomfortable and disruptive. “At night,
                                        I would be lying in bed, just on the verge
                                        of going to sleep, and I would get these 
                                        feelings in my legs that I needed to make go away.
                                        It was a tingling sensation-my legs would 
                                        feel like something was crawling deep inside them.
                                        I felt like I had to move my legs and then would 
                                        start tossing and turning. Sometimes, I had to get
                                        out of bed and walk to relieve the feelings. 
                                        This would usually go on for quite some time, preventing 
                                        me from falling asleep.” Beth knew that what she was
                                        experiencing wasn’t normal, so she started talking to 
                                        others about her symptoms. At the time, her doctors 
                                        did not know how to help her. Beth even thought the 
                                        symptoms might be related to her diet or exercise habits.
                                        “I was frustrated. Night after night, I would feel the 
                                        same creepy-crawly sensations in my legs, and getting up
                                        to relieve the feelings would keep me from falling asleep. 
                                        Sometimes, I would get these sensations during the day if 
                                        I was sitting for a long time: I couldn’t really sit and read, 
                                        watch TV, go to the movies. Travel became difficult because
                                        I couldn’t sit for long periods of time on airplanes or in the car.”
                                        Recently, Beth saw an article about Restless Legs Syndrome 
                                        (RLS) in a local newspaper. It described RLS as a
                                        common and disruptive neurological condition that is 
                                        characterized by a compelling urge to move the legs and by
                                        uncomfortable or sometimes painful sensations in the legs. 
                                        These sensations are frequently described as creeping-crawling, 
                                        tingling, pulling or tightening in the legs.
                                        Beth wondered if this could be the same condition she had
                                        lived with for all these years. She brought the article to her
                                        doctor to help her describe what she was experiencing. 
                                        After an examination, Beth’s physician diagnosed her with RLS, 
                                        a recognized-and now treatable-medical condition.
                                        “I’m relieved to know that what I’ve been experiencing is 
                                        a recognized medical condition. For me, my RLS diagnosis 
                                        was an important step forward in my quest for relief from 
                                        the disruptive creepy-crawly feelings that I had lived with for so long.”
                                        In May 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Requip

                                        For most of us, the idea of astronomy is something we directly connect 
                                        to “stargazing”, telescopes and seeing magnificent displays in the heavens.
                                        And to be sure, that is the exciting area of astronomy that accounts 
                                        for it’s huge popularity. So to the uninitiated, the idea of “radio astronomy”
                                        seems strange. There are two reasons for that. First is that humans are far
                                        more visual than audio oriented. And the second is that radio astronomy 
                                        doesn’t really involve “listening” to the cosmos except to the extent
                                        that scientists who use this sophisticated form of “stargazing” do not 
                                        rely on visual study to conduct their work.
                                        To appreciate what is really exciting about radio astronomy, first we have 
                                        to shift how we view astronomy. That is because to professional astronomers, 
                                        studying the universe is more about frequencies than it is about visual 
                                        documentation of phenomenon. This takes us back to Physics 101.
                                        Light, obviously, is the physical phenomenon that empowers our 
                                        ability to use our visual confirmation system, e.g. our eyes to 
                                        appreciate something, in this case the stars. So when we look up 
                                        at the heavens, we can see the light emitting from a star or reflecting
                                        from a planet or moon. In many cases, if we see a far away star,
                                        we are actually seeing it hundreds or thousands of years ago because 
                                        that is how long it takes for that light to cross the universe and be
                                        visible in our sky. That alone is a pretty mind blowing idea.
                                        Now light itself is a pretty strange substance. But to our astronomy
                                        scientists, light is just another energy that exists in a certain frequency. 
                                        Now, we tend to think of frequencies when we talk about sound waves.
                                        In scientific terms light, energy and sound are just a few forms of the 
                                        same thing, frequencies of energy that are emulating from a source. 
                                        Now we get to why radio astronomy is so necessary. The range of frequency
                                        that light occupies in the big spectrum of frequencies is really pretty small.
                                        To put that more bluntly, we can only “see” a tiny part of the universe that
                                        is actually there. Now when you look up in the night sky and it is so 
                                        overwhelming, when you then that we are seeing just a tiny amount of what is 
                                        actually going on up there, again, our minds can get pretty overwhelmed.
                                        Radio astronomy uses sophisticated sensor equipment to study ALL of the 
                                        frequencies of energy coming to us from the cosmos. In that way, these 
                                        scientists can “see” everything that is going on out there and so get a 
                                        precise idea of how the stars look, behave now and will behave in the future.
                                        For some of us who have heard about radio astronomy, we think of it in terms
                                        of “listening” for signs of life in the universe. And yes, SETI, or 
                                        “the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence” is a part of radio astronomy,
                                        albeit a tiny part. But of much greater importance is how radio astronomy
                                        has empowered serious astronomers (that is those who get paid to do it)
                                        to study stars many light years away, to study black holes which we could 
                                        never see with our telescopes and to gather research and data about 
                                        the whole of the universe that otherwise would be impossible to know 
                                        and understand.
                                        This is important work that is constantly ongoing in the world of astronomy. 
                                        It is worth keeping up with and learning more about as we have barely
                                        scratched the surface in our brief discussion today. But understanding
                                        how important radio astronomy is will only deepen and make more meaningful
                                        your love and grasp of this big field of knowledge known as astronomy.

                                        HDMI, or high definition multimedia interface, is a type of audio 
                                        and video interface that is used for the transmission of uncompressed 
                                        digital streams. Essentially, HDMI can be considered an alternative method
                                        to transmitting data streams, rather than making use of conventional 
                                        methods such as coaxial cabling, VGA, or component video equipment. 
                                        What Type of Sources May Be Employed Using HDMI?

                                        Quite a number of devices and sources on the market today will 
                                        work with the use of HDMI. The Blu-Ray disc player, a relatively
                                        new innovation, was created with the use of HDMI specifically in mind.
                                        Most personal computers that are sold today are ready for use with 
                                        HDMI, as are the majority of video game consoles in the stores currently.
                                        A set-top box also is usually compatible with HDMI, as are such 
                                        entertainment options as digital television. Essentially, any type of 
                                        computer interface today will function with the use of HDMI. How Does HDMI Work?

                                        HDMI will work with a single cable connection to such devices as televisions 
                                        or personal computers. In general, HDMI will function fine with any television 
                                        or PC that is standard, enhanced, or high definition in the video component.
                                        However, it is important to note that HDMI does work independently of many 
                                        of the DTV standards, although use of HDMI will not impact the quality of
                                        the digital transmission. Generally, these standards apply to some 
                                        configurations of MPEG movie clips and files. Since these are compressed,
                                        HDMI will simply decompress the data and make it possible to view the clip.
                                        Are All HDMI Versions The Same For All Devices?

                                        No. There is a range of specifications that are employed by HDMI, and a given 
                                        device will be manufactured to comply with one of those specifications. 
                                        The most simplistic specification is identified as 1.0. With each succeeding
                                        version, the capabilities of the previous version remain intact, but are 
                                        joined by other capabilities that will allow the version to function with a 
                                        given device. Because technology is always advancing, HDMI continues to
                                        advance as well. However, older versions remain active, as they are often used
                                        with devices that require less functionality, and they also continue to be 
                                        helpful in situations where older systems are still running and are in 
                                        operation. Where Did HDMI Come From?

                                        HDMI was created and has been enhanced by the efforts of several prominent
                                        names in the computer and electronics industry. Consumers will recognize 
                                        the names of Philips, Sony, Toshiba, and Silicon Image as just part of the 
                                        roster of corporations involved in the ongoing enhancement of HDMI.

                                    Motorhome or Trailer that is the question for you.
                                    Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages
                                    of both, so you will be confident when purchasing an RV.
                                    When comparing Rvs, a motorhome or a travel 
                                    trailer, should you buy a motorhome or fifth 
                                    wheeler? The advantages and disadvantages 
                                    of both are studied so that you can make 
                                    your choice wisely when purchasing an RV. 
                                    Possessing a motorhome or fifth wheel is 
                                    an achievement of a lifetime. It can be
                                    similar to sojourning with your residence 
                                    as you search the various sites of our great land, America.
                                    The two commonly known recreational vehicle
                                    classes are the motorized and towable. 
                                    Towable rvs are the travel trailers and 
                                    the fifth wheel. The rv travel trailer 
                                    or fifth wheel has the attraction of getting
                                    towed by a pickup or a car, thus giving 
                                    the adaptability of possessing transportation
                                    for you when you are parked at your campsite. 
                                    A motorhome is a recreational vehicle that
                                    is motorized. It has three categories which
                                    can either be gas, diesel or Diesel Pushers 
                                    which are the most costly ones. Converted 
                                    vans that are large and self-sustaining 
                                    represent the smaller types of motorhomes
                                    and then there are the ones that are built 
                                    on the chassis of a truck.. The motorized
                                    motor home needs a tow car for your transportation 
                                    after you set up in your campsite.
                                    Rvs are styled to your specifications for 
                                    the best appearance and luxuries you 
                                    anticipate when possessing an rv. 
                                    High standard artisanship, venues for 
                                    entertainment, and keenness to small
                                    bits of information can be applied into
                                    an rv bearing in mind that each and every 
                                    amenity comes with a price tag.
                                    A travel trailer or fifth wheel is larger
                                    inside than a motorhome of the same size 
                                    because of the driving area, i.e. a 40 foot 
                                    trailer or fifth wheel has more livable 
                                    space than a 40 foot motorhome. 
                                    Towing a trailer with a car puts a lot of 
                                    wear and tear on the automobile because 
                                    they are usually not equipped for heavy duty towing.
                                    The motor home is definitely more money 
                                    because you are paying for the driving 
                                    mechanism and chassis. Trailers and motorhomes
                                    can be equipped with the same options. 
                                    So the question seems to be do I want to 
                                    travel in a truck pulling a large fifth 
                                    wheel or ride in a motorhome pulling a tow car.
                                    One thing is certain if you talk to a 
                                    motorhome owner he will tell you that you 
                                    should definitely purchase a motorhome 
                                    and the same goes for a travel trailer or
                                    fifth wheel owner, he thinks the trailer 
                                    is the only way to go.  No matter what you 
                                    choose the experiences are out of this world.

                                    This is a popular question people ask me.

                                    of Deliberate Attraction? Is there an advanced
                                    course I can take? My answer is always the same,
                                    “The application of this material into your daily 
                                    life IS the advanced course!” To help you gauge
                                    where you’re at in the mastery of Law of Attraction,
                                    I’ve compiled a list of seven sure-fire 
                                    ways to tell if YOU are joining the thousands 
                                    of people who really are mastering this stuff.
                                    7 TOP indicators that I am mastering Law of Attraction
                                    1. I understand and accept that Law of 
                                    Attraction is a process. It is a process 
                                    of gradually reducing the negative vibrational
                                    patterns I have towards some areas in my
                                    life and replacing them with positive thoughts.
                                    Through the intentional and deliberate use of 
                                    the tools of Law of Attraction, I see 
                                    evidence that my allowing is gradually increasing.
                                    2. Over time I am seeing some behavioural 
                                    changes in myself. Even though I constantly
                                    hear others using don’t, not and no I have
                                    eventually stopped using these words out loud.
                                    Each time I catch myself even thinking these
                                    words, I automatically ask myself the question,
                                    “So what DO I want?” I know that when I change
                                    my words, my vibration changes and I can 
                                    only hold one vibration at a time.
                                    3. I’ve noticed over time that I am observing
                                    contrast (anything that doesn’t feel good to me) 
                                    more and more briefly.
                                    4. I’ve noticed that I am having fewer
                                    and fewer experiences of negative people
                                    and events in my life. 5. It’s become
                                    second nature for me to be aware of many
                                    , many more things that I can appreciate
                                    and express gratitude for.
                                    6. I find myself automatically assigning 
                                    all my new desires to Law of Attraction.
                                    When I want something new in my life 
                                    I say, “I’m using Law of Attraction to get that!”
                                    7. I understand the expression I get what
                                    I vibrate and I hold myself fully accountable

                                    There is a moment in the life of any aspiring
                                    astronomer that it is time to buy that first telescope.
                                    It’s exciting to think about setting up 
                                    your own viewing station whether that is 
                                    on the deck of your home or having a powerful
                                    but mobile telescope set up to take to 
                                    the remove countryside to really get a good
                                    shot at some breath taking star gazing.
                                    The last thing we would want to do is to 
                                    take away any of the “fun” of your hobby 
                                    of astronomy because the joy of what we
                                    do as star gazers is a big part of the appeal.
                                    But unlike many other hobbies, ours is a 
                                    passion of science, of learning and of discovery.
                                    And don’t kid yourself, even a hobbyist with
                                    a limited telescopic set up can see some 
                                    amazing things in the stars. So let’s be sure
                                    you invest in a solid piece of equipment 
                                    that you can continue to grow with as your
                                    knowledge and ability as an astronomer grows.
                                    But how do we do that?
                                    Meet the Geeks.
                                    Now we use the term “telescope geeks” lovingly
                                    because any of us who are devoted to our love
                                    of astronomy eventually become telescope geeks.
                                    And these are the type of people who will know 
                                    exactly how to evaluate your needs in terms 
                                    of where you are right now and where you want
                                    to go as your hobby grows with you. So if 
                                    you have not yet associated with a local 
                                    astronomy club, now is the time to do it. 
                                    Start rubbing elbows with people who live
                                    and breathe telescopes. Their input is a 
                                    hundred times more reliable than what a 
                                    sales brochure or that salesman might have 
                                    to say because the “telescope geeks” have
                                    been where you are, made the mistakes and
                                    are eager to help you avoid those same mistakes.
                                    Size Matters
                                    In the world of telescopes, the sales people
                                    see, to try to baffle us with all the bells
                                    and whistles of their hottest selling model.
                                    One of the big check points that is often 
                                    pushed is the amplification level of the 
                                    telescope lens. While that is a factor that
                                    is worth noting, when it comes to a telescope 
                                    lens, the old phrase “size matters” is a good guideline.
                                    Just remember that your telescope lens works
                                    best when it takes in the most light it 
                                    can from the object you are viewing. 
                                    So the wider the diameter of the lens,
                                    the better a view you are going to get.
                                    So don’t fall for the amplification level only.
                                    Carefully evaluate the lens size so you
                                    have the right fit for what you want to do.
                                    It Has to Stand on Its Own Feet.
                                    If you are going to set up a permanent
                                    telescope station, then you can bolt the
                                    unit down so it is well supported. But many 
                                    of us have to take our telescopes out into 
                                    the country for optimum use. So the stand
                                    has to be strong and flexible so we can 
                                    set up the telescope on uneven turf but 
                                    still feel secure that this important and 
                                    expensive piece of equipment is going to
                                    stand on its own without fear of it falling 
                                    during our observation time. 
                                    We already mentioned strong and flexible 
                                    as evaluation guides for the telescope 
                                    stand but add in ease of use as well. 
                                    You have to be able to set your telescope
                                    up and break it down quickly and easily 
                                    when you are on a remote viewing. You may
                                    even find yourself setting up or taking
                                    down your telescope in the dark or by lantern
                                    or flashlight if you are taking advantage 
                                    of the great star displays in the late night
                                    sky that make this hobby so exciting. 
                                    These are the basics of what to look for 
                                    in your new telescope. Finally, make sure 
                                    the telescope can be enhanced and expanded
                                    without having to throw the first unit away
                                    and buy something completely new. You want
                                    your telescope to grow as your knowledge 
                                    and skills grow. If your first telescope 
                                    meets all of these requirements, you are 
                                    off on the right foot on a long and enjoyable
                                    career as an amateur astronomer.
